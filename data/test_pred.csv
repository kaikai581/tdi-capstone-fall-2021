The fourth game in the CS series (If you rule out the japanese ones), CSGO is quickly described as an updated CSS but with much better graphics, animations, more content aswell as a whole new shooting system. There are alot of old weapons from the previous games, though all having their different stats changed to suit CSGO's new system. 8 new weapons are introduced aswell, some replacing previous ones from the other games. As for playable characters, CSGO has a whole new layout. Previous CS games had 4 (CSCZ 5) characters to choose from after selecting a team. This isn't the case with CSGO, here you are forced to be one out of 5 almost identical characters from a certain faction. As an example, anarchists, all sharing the same model, but wearing different masks and small details. Several previous factions, like the phoenix connexion, return, though not all, like the arctic avengers. While the increase of factions has made CSGO interesting to play, sadly since its launch 2 years ago, the game has yet to have seen any new added factions. Visually the whole game feels more down to earth and realistic. The default maps are plenty, and several old maps from previous games return, including Aztec, office, vertigo, dust maps among others. Something new in this CS game that wasn't in previous games, is weapon skins. The idea coming from Team Fortress 2, you have a chance of getting item drops at the end of each game. It could be a weapon skin or a case (TF2's version being the crate). Using a skin will replace the default weapon's looks. You can trade or sell these weapon skins and cases over the steam market, or buy from the market itself with real currency. This CS game also introduces competetive play. Searching for a match, you are teamed up with 4 other random players to fight against 5 other players on the opposing team. Playing 15 rounds in total. Each time you win, you get closer to getting a better rank. Same goes if you lose a match, you get closer to getting your rank decreased. Usually with this rank system, you are played against and with players on the same rank. Almost. It is a common thing that you face against players near your rank. Rarely ever exactly the same rank. You can also play with friends, despite their rank being either lower or better than yours. This leads to a very unbalanced rank system that CSGO has. The community is by far the most negative thing about this CS game. It is very common for players to insult each other, making this community by far the worst of all gaming communities in history, even exceeding the CoD communities. Be wary if you are very sensitive to insults. This community is also known for its scamming for weapon skins. Because of the high amounts some of the more rare items cost over the steam market, alot of scamming goes about with different ways to trick other players into giving their weapons for free or lesser priced skins. Valve has stated they won't be able to help you if you get tricked. The most common trick is a random user on steam adding you, then sending you a link if you add them. If you press on this link, you risk getting a virus that will take over your account. Overall this CS game is worth every cent. But be wary of its community.",,0,"Dec 18, 2014, 7:16AM",0.7272727272727271,11,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.9640718562874251, 'num_achievements_attained': 161}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg,8,Sivarg,52.0,3,962.1,Miss Selfie,3,Recommended,279.0,5326,6,15,351,0.721982105840437,0.7455746

It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that makes the difference. But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers. I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition. Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc. The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time. Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player! Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters. And their patience level with newcomers is about 0. So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:) If you can't practice in a competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play? Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training. And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good! Still playing daily, and still loving it! So... recommended? Hell yeh!

Yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an ""average"" player may take well over 100 hours. However, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, DOTA 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free.","Dec 29, 2013, 5:59AM",0,"Dec 2, 2013, 8:31PM",0.785714285714285,14,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.8023952095808381, 'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_attained': 134}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/roarjr,11,roarjr,45.0,3,2298.4,RoarJr,0,Recommended,73.0,236,0,8,277,0.6798002007265336,0.62986606

Of course the engine / card / injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do I keep falling for their scummy tricks...

The game itself takes place in Skyrim's land. A civil war between Stormcloak and the Imperial Legion. The Story Begins With The Jailed Guy, Who Escaped And Take A Journy To Nearby Riverwood. The Guy Gone To A Fight With A Dragon With Whiterun's Guards, After They Killed It, The Played (Guy) Absorbed The Dragon's Blood, Because He Has The Ability To Absorb Blood, Guards Got Shocked By That Absorption; The Player ( Guy) Is The Dragonborn; The History Of Dragons And More. Gameplay The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, Can Be playable Either a first or third-person, But Mainly First-Person. Skyrim's Genre RPG, Action and Adventure, But Maily RPG. It's Pretty Rare To See An Impressed Griping RPG. Skryim is not a normal RPG nor Action, It's an exceptional pretty rare to see RPG and Action. The Game Itself will have been taken from you more than 100 hours, I already have reached to ""Almost"" 100 Hour and atleast haven't reached at 45%. It's So So So Big Game that Nobody can expect its lengh (Expect for the main story its short), Speakin' generally 350 hour means 60% of the game Pretty Sure, Last Word ""Time Killer"". Graphics Story AWESOME, Gameplay is better than the story and Graphics is the head of Skyrim or skyrim's skill. Why The Graphics is the best of Skyrim? Beautiful environment, Beautiful shadow effects, The Appropriate Atmosphere specially in a combat. everything you have seen in Uncharted 1, 2 and 3 you'll find better than Uncharted's environment. Head Of Graphics.. Bethesda labeled correctely. Not Incorrectely. Even in low feels pretty good feels in high comparing it to some. ""MASTERPIECE"". Sounds Skyrim's Sounds is the opposite of reality which means ""imagination"" That Really didn't work!! Hit The Floor Feels Shredding Cotton Or Wool, Mostly Every Single Sound Feels Shredding; Not neat. That is the first negative in the game. Doesn't feel happy or something feels BAD. Hit A Person Feels An Electronic thing has blow away. All I Can Say Good But Still Very Very Veryx10 Not Neat. Music FUS RO DAH. Fighting A Dragon A Track Plays To Change Your Reaction Effects Into Excited. When Bored In Playing A Track Plays To Change Your Boredom Effects. Absorbing A Dragon Soul Makes Civilians Shocked And The Player Too; From The Awesome Happiness. Every Track Can Change Your Affects And Makes You Wonder Why Singers Wouldn't Make Those Emotional Tracks?; Skyrim's Tracks. Pretty Rare To See, Pretty Rare To Find, Pretty Rare To Effect Your Emotional Feeling, Pretty Rare To Find Better, Pretty Rare To Everything You Could Ever Feel Free To Ask For. The Verdict The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Took Game Of The Year Before, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Took Game Of The Year 2011. For Me, It's Prettyx10 Rare To Give A Game A 10 Out Of 10, Sence All The Games that I Have Been Playing It, Skyrim Is The Best RPG Game I Have Ever Played. Fallout 3 Took A 10 Out Of 10, In My Personal Opinion Just 3 Game Took A 10 Out Of 10. In Every RPG Game I Don't Spend More Than 50 Hours. I Just Have Spend My More Than 50 Hours In Borderlands 2 And Skyrim, The Best Three RPG Games Of My Entire Are: Final Fantasy 7, Fallout 3 and Borderlands 2 But Skyrim Is Very Very Very Away Better Than All Of Them. Skyrim Is A Brilliant Game And ""Time Killer Or Waster"". Skyrim Is One Of The Very Best Games Of The Entire History. You'll Never Forget The Experience And Everything. The Best Method Of Modifying Describing And Visualizing It Is PLAY IT. Story: 9.5/10 Gameplay: 9.5/10 Graphics: 9.5/10 Sounds: 7/10 Music: 10/10 + Positives Side Missions Can Make A Big Story+Awesome Leveling Up System+Great Story+350 Hours Means 60% Of The Game; So Big Game+Training A Skill Can Cause Alot Of Time+Music Matters In The Gameplay Reaction+Nobody Can Find Better Than This RPG Game (Just RPG)+Gives You The Freedom To Explore+War Battles Are Pretty Fun+Awesome Dragons Combat - Negatives -Still Bugy And Glitch-You Might Get stick In A Spot-Not Neat Sounds-Pretty Easy To Cheat-Isn't Easy To Learn For Some People Skyrim, The Best You'll Find, MUST-PLAY!

I spent a while trying to sum it up with a genre but it borrows from several. Mass Effect with jumping! It's a third person shooter/brawler that puts you in the role of a Tenno, a nearly extinct race awaking to find several factions ruining the galaxy and various shenanigans occuring that are for your detriment. Going on missions in various space stations, ships and planets using tons of weapons and warframes in a free2play game that looks and plays like a current gen AAA game. + Good Graphics & Sound Design + Large amound of varied enemies, unique styles and boss battles. + Procedurally generated maps with dozens of tile sets. + Very satisfying gunplay and indepth melee combat/combo system. + Fantastic replay value. + Hundreds of weapons covering all different categories and type & Plenty of warframes to get with very unique abilities. + Decent story and universe created. + F2P - Lack of direction to new players after initial quests. - Late game can slowly get repetetive. - Minor inconveniences to be had if not spending any real money. - PvP is currently Peer2Peer and very laggy with no tangible rewards for putting time into it. - A lot of mechanics go unexplained unless you actively check the codex/wiki. In essence you are able to progress through hundreds of missions that are instanced for up to 4 players in a squad, completing random objectives in procedurally generated maps against one of the 5 possible enemy factions (or sometimes a combination!) This is a solid formula, with a lot of different planet/map tilesets, a ton of very well crafted rooms and a very hefty roster of enemies for each of the main faction. Combine this with the hundreds of weapons you can craft (varying from pistols to grenade launchers to crossbows to electric boomerangs to rail guns), 20+ warframes (classes with very unique 4 abilities, akin to a MOBA) to choose from, a very good looking engine and some solid gunplay/melee combat and you've got a fantastic game in it's own right. You level up and upgrade all of your gear with mods that drop from enemies constantly, so everyone can tailor their weapons and warframe to their own liking and you do get a very solid sense of progression. You can parkour around the maps, wall run, pull of some complex melee combos and act like a space ninja, or you can be moving from cover to cover, co-ordinating with your team and playing it through like a tactical third person shooter. It has a very good looking engine that stands up by todays standards depiste the game being nearly 3 years old (counting the closed beta) It's got a godly particle system, as well as full usage of PhysX, very cool looking units and maps and a consistent art style throughout. The sound design is very competent but the music stands out the most, there are several dynamic sound tracks when fighting each of the factions that change depending on how much combat is happening but they all sound very unique and cool to listen to in the middle of some hectic shenanigans. The kicker being that this is completely free to play. This is a hybrid co-op/MMO without the 1-9 button smashing on the keyboard and it relies entirely on your skill with the weapons, abilities and movement to be good. It being a F2P MMO esque game, you do have to craft new weapons and warframes which take time but due to how inherently fun the actual gameplay is, farming for materials or blueprints never feels like a chore and 99% of the time you'll be collecting more than enough materials just while playing normally. There's a ton of PvE mission types, some new PvP, horde modes, a space combat mode (think zone of the enders) and plenty of replay value inbetween. There are several story quests and tutorial missions to all new players a grasp on all of the basic mechanics however once the tutorials are over you are just sort of left to your own devices. The lack of constant direction might annoy a few players but I strongly reccomend just deciding that you want to go and check out a planet or get a cool weapon then work toward those goals, seeing new things and acquiring more equipment on the way. Planets have bosses, new planets need to be unlocked and so on so there are tangible goals to set yourself. You can create a clan with your friends, build a very large Dojo that can be used for trading, researching exclusive weaponry, dueling, storing event trophies as well as assisting in building solar rails for the very large scale PvP solar rail conflicts. I would reccomend if you're really into it getting just a few dollars worth of platinum then buying a scarf, they're cool, because it's in space.","Feb 9, 2015, 1:40PM",0,"Feb 9, 2015, 1:17PM",0.9090909090909092,11,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/drfragg,10,drfragg,,1,1473.7,Dr.Fragg,0,Recommended,,0,0,0,0,0.7623197460146655,0.77817124

Playing with, or without a team of friends, competitive or casual, this game delivers consistent fun that never really gets old. The dynamics and balance of class-based shooter gameplay that exists in this game is unparalleled anywhere else that Ive seen, with no one way to play being superior. The pay-to-advance mechanics in other freemium games aren't present here, as aside from a few utility unlocks and different play styles, the stock weapons are largely the best for every character, with the microtransation and trading economies being largely cosmetic and for non gameplay-affecting in nature. The support for competitive play is amazing, with all levels of skill supported, and many servers dedicated to skill improvement, in addition to casual gaming. The community is also amazing, with no shortage of community content, media, artwork, and a plethora of gaming networks that bring the TF2niverse to life outside the game, and into the rest of the world. (Still waiting for the civilian bobblehead from Meet the Sniper) There is also a virtual macro economy, with Valve's random item distribution system leading to a diverse market for all things TF2, within TF2; hats, specialty weapons, memorabilia items, that can all be used in-game to customize your character and add depth to your actions in-game and within the steam community. The bugs due to lack of optimization, and occasional grief caused by players abusing vote-related moderation systems are the only two things that I can complain about with this game, as it's good, wholesome fun regardless if you're just starting, or are a competitive pro. Even though this game is nearly 7 years old, the community that plays it really brings it to life once you get into it and with the nonstop fun that it provides, Its one of the genuinely few online games that I can wholeheartedly give my seal of approval to. Do i reccomend this game? Of course. There's no boring tedium of waiting around for your opponent to act, and hard-set roles and proceedures that needs to be adhered to, lest your team's fun gets ruined thanks to one person slipping up like in many of the other games these days. (heck, you can charge at a rocket launcher-wielding enemy with a claymore sword, and kill him if you pull it off correctly) I think it allows for more personal expression and playstyles than i think exist in a lot of games. 9.5/10 for doing everything right that can be done in an online shooter, and actually listening to the concerns of the community. Also for providing not just something fun to play, but a universe to be part of.","Mar 19, 2014, 10:39PM",0,"Mar 19, 2014, 10:38PM",0.95505617977528,178,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.9536679536679531, 'num_achievements_attained': 494}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/323425621343254657435674,170,323425621343254657435674,44.0,8,3730.5,Captain Blades #TF2ArmsDeal,1,Recommended,76.0,59,2,7,29,0.7749880560488442,0.78121203

To start off with the cons: This game will take a couple hundred hours to learn to a decent level, and if you are considering buying it... do yourself a favor and buy at least the Brave New World DLC with it, or you will be missing about half of the game and will have to deal with an unnacceptably broken combat system. Also the multiplayer servers are extremely unreliable, it is very difficult to play out a full game with random players (if everyone in the game is your friend you can save the game regularly, and reinvite everyone when it crashes). Unlike most strategy games, Civilization V is much more than simply military confrontation/combat. Every player leads one of histories civilizations from the start of time, when military combat is limited to club warriors and ancient archers, and your empire consists of a single, small, undeveloped town, until the information era, by which time the players in the lead would have nuclear weaponry, modern armor, helicopter gunships, internet, and stealth fighters, and your civilization could have over a dozen cities, each up to 50 times larger than your original village. The success of your civilization depends not only on your battlefield prowess, although it is a necessary component, but in your ability to build your civilizations economy, science, and culture faster than your neighboring civilizations, and in keeping your civilizations population happy. A serious setback in any of these parameters will affect all of them, and will allow other civilizations in the game to bypass you, and eventually either destroy you or win peacefull through science, culture, or diplomacy. A major positive about the game, especially in singleplayer, is the diversity of the strategies you can use, with each particular civilzation usually suited only to one or two win conditions.","Aug 28, 2014, 12:58PM",0,"Aug 22, 2014, 3:16PM",0.916666666666666,12,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.42857142857142805, 'num_achievements_attained': 123, 'num_achievements_possible': 287}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055992952,11,76561198055992952,10.0,1,2076.6,Tigris of Gaul,0,Recommended,72.0,53,1,1,20,0.7572740618762704,0.82580775

A great range of classes to choose from. Scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective (capture the flag, pushing cart) and just generally annoying people. Soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer, a shotgun, and a entrenching tool (shovel) soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2. The Pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he/she uses his/hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive. The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc) and a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with big  weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind! The engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top! The medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them! That is all the classes in team fotress 2! I hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server!

From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years. Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there. With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed. I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more. The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully. I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other. And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back. But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this. All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.","Apr 16, 2015, 10:40AM",0,"Oct 16, 2014, 3:17PM",0.8203125,128,"{'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheekybanterlads,105,cheekybanterlads,,23,389.9,DeliciousHotSchmoes,0,Recommended,,0,1,0,0,0.7249983060265318,0.7325808

The company essentially bundled in-game cash DLC with the base game, raised the price of the bundle to $80, and marked the bundle 25% off so that it sold ""on sale"" for the regular base price of $60. On top of this, Rockstar (initially) pulled the base game from their store page, which made it seem like the cash card bundle was the only version of the game you could purchase (effectively hiding the fact that the base game is not actually on sale). To top everything off though, purchasing the cash card bundle is basically Rockstar's way of skirting around Steam's new refund policy. Buying the bundle and starting up the game immediately ties the cash card to your account, which disqualifies you from requesting a refund even if you play the game for less than two hours.

Ever since a friend got me into this game, I've been playing it non-stop for more than 200 play hours in total, and I would like to take the time to give my own thoughts on the game as a whole and some tips for newcomers to help them on their way to enjoy the game and not ragequit within the first 20 minutes of jumping right into it. First off, gameplay-wise the game is a typical multiplayer-based FPS game where the core goal is very simplistic: Hop on either the red or blue team and kill the opposing team and secure victory, however, the methods of accomplishing this range per match type, and usually good teamwork and class diversity are required to win the match. As for said class diversity, the game offers you 9 different playable class characters to choose from, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it's a key requirement for any player to learn the limits and strengths of those classes in order to play the class effectively and to be of benefit to your team as a whole. Thankfully the game has a alright tutorial on a few classes, specifically the Demoman, Spy, Engineer and Soldier, but there are many tricks for a class that the game doesn't often directly tell you, but rather clues you in through the in-game loading screen tips section when you go to a match. Picking a class that suits your playstyle is often the first thing many new players struggle with, but the classes all range from fairly easy to pick up and play decently with, to far more tricky and fragile ones that require the player to be familiar with the mechanics and overall gameplay before they can effectively use them in combat. Such examples are the Heavy, Soldier and Pyro which in my opinion are some of the more easily accessable classes for new players to experiment around with, and Engineer, Sniper and Spy for the more experienced players when they feel confident enough. It has something for every kind of FPS gamer regardless of skill level, which is what I really like about this game. Atmosphere-wise, the game is very visually pleasing with alot of intricate map design accomodating the various matchtypes, and is designed so that players who are unfamiliar with the map and it's pathways are given visual cues on where to go, like if they're on the red team, a red arrow sign will point in the general direction where they need to head to, as well as various signs detailing a mission's objective and locations, like 'Intelligence' for the intel briefcase on capture the flag, 'Battlements' for the general middle area where most of the combat will take place, etc. The classes all have dynamic personalities that make them a blast to play as and you'll often chuckle at their lines regarding the situation, which really gives this game alot of personality. I personally really enjoy the Pyro because the character itself wears a gas mask which makes most of his lines almost inaudiable, but if you listen carefully you can make out a few key lines that he screams out. Besides the game's addictive core gameplay, there's alot of side content to it like customizable loadouts to your class' arsenal, cosmetic clothing and different taunts which you usually have to acquire through specific unlocking methods, crafting from metal which you get from turning additional weapons into metal which you obtain from random weapon drops during gameplay or trading with other players. Trading is one of the key mechanics of interacting with other players, and interacting with other players is oftentimes a good way of getting to meet a nice friend on Steam wether it's someone on your team, or someone you encounter while on a specific trade server, and who might be able to trade or even gift you some stuff if you're friendly to the player and and he/she is friendly to you in return. Just be careful of annoying or pushy players who are out for your items and will offer either nothing or nearly worthless items in return, though, if you happen to encounter those, just ignore them. There is also a Mann vs. Machine co-op game mode in where you get to work together with 5 other players being the limit against a horde of powerful robots trying to defend your area from a bomb they will attempt to deliver at all costs. This game mode is much more intense than regular multiplayer TF2 and you can earn nice cosmetic item rewards for your weapons in the Mann Up mode, but the Bootcamp mode is free to play and a good way for practice, but Mann vs. Machine is very tough and is not recommended for newcomers of TF2 to try out immediately. With that all out of the way, here are a few tips I would recommend everybody who's going to try this game out to follow if they want to have a pleasant experience playing this game in the long run: - Always stay friendly to other players and don't act obnoxious or self-righteous to others. The name of the game is TEAM Fortress 2, meaning that in order to win, you need to work together as a team, and not go out there, thinking you can take the entire team on yourself, which will oftentimes lead to you getting killed over and over again. Communicate with your fellow team members over the situation and what you're planning to do, or regarding plans or tactics that the enemy team is using through the default Y normal in-game chat and U team members-only chat window buttons. Your team members will appreciate it if you're friendly, and will be much more likely to co-operate alongside with you towards completing the objective if you do so. Sure the game can get very hectic and is easy to get annoyed over a supposed 'cheap kill' from a enemy player, but overall try to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the game. - If nessecary, do offline training on maps that you're unfamiliar with, and explore the maps so you'll know the shortcuts and side routes into enemy territory. This is a key factor into becoming a more skilled player over time, as there are many side routes that are often easy to miss or not pay attention to that the developers of the maps implemented in order to balance the game and make it possible for a team to overcome the other if they're being pressured or having difficulty breaking through chokepoints. If the enemy team is spawncamping, try to take a different spawn exit and flank them from behind. If the main route into their base is heavily guarded, look for a alternate pathway to take and inform your teammates about it. - Play classes that suit the current situation. This is a common mistake that I see occuring alot on many servers I play on, as quite alot of players seem to not grasp the limits of a class and oftentimes like to stick to one class only just because they like playing as that certain class and refuse to play anything else that the team might benefit more at that specific point during the match. Players need to observe the situation and pick classes whose advantages are required at the time. To give a good example, payload is a match type in where the red team needs to defend the bomb from being delivered by the blue team, and as such will be spawn-camping right off the bat during the start of the match. Yet alot of times there tend to be about 2 or 3 Spy and/or Sniper players in a team of roughly 9 to 12 players on blue. Those 2 classes can only take out 1 enemy at a time normally, and will be killed easily. You'll need a strong offensive class like Heavy or Soldier to pressure and kill the enemy team, and if your team doesn't have a Medic, be one. Medic isn't a easy class, but your team members will benefit from the healing so they won't have to retreat to the supply closet often. Class diversity and good communication about class choices mid-game can go a long way in winning the match. Thanks for reading this, and hope it was insightful. I definetely recommend this game!","Sep 24, 2014, 3:38AM",0,"Sep 23, 2014, 1:48PM",0.846153846153846,26,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.899613899613899, 'num_achievements_attained': 466}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078215383,22,76561198078215383,4.0,4,1401.7,RustyRick,0,Recommended,144.0,14,3,3,25,0.7422221225125045,0.69474715

Game play is awesome, endless hours of farming and grinding, it is truely an MMO players dream, however the game has far too many bugs that the Support team refuse to do anything about, from constant log issues to frozen UI the support team always recommend you allow the game to run through firewall, no matter the issue. Personally I find no use in firewall, it does nothing but slow me down, and I keep my computer clean, physically and digitally, so for me, I have no use what so ever for firewall and it is always disabled. Still everytime I run into an issue while playing (which I must say, happens literally once or twice an hour) and report it to the support team, they always tell me the same thing, ""Allow the system to run through firewall."" but when I exclaim to them that this cannot be the problem I am met with an apology and instructions on how to allow a program through firewall. Its a great game with a terrible support team.

PROS + Improved graphics, soldier equipment is detailed + Improved movement features, leaning, several sitting positions etc. + Bullet ballistics + Big areas available for play as an Islands CONS - Horrible and non realistic human damage system (aka CS-like) - Fictional and not practically realistic weapons - Helicopter can lift and carry a heavy MBT while it is using its main gun in the air... - Sniper can shoot a person sitting inside armed IFV... - Aircraft/Helicopter simulation is at the PS2 arcade flying sim level... - Tank/Vehicle control is simply W A S D + Mouse click, horribly simplified - Vehicle movement on a terrain is a joke, totally screwed up physics - Helicopter can lift 5 ton truck, drop it from 10m and truck continues to drive normally... - Flying physics for Aircrafts/helicopters is a laughable joke - Shooting enemy Aircraft with AA Vehicle is all about ""button-press-hold-click"" - TONS of bugs without attention.

If that's our standard for goodness... then no wonder this country's screwed."" - Michael De Santa STORY (No Spoilers) Grand Theft Auto V pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists: Michael, a married man suffering from a midlife crisis, Franklin, a gangster trying to make a change for himself, and Trevor, who's just a Canadian psychopath. The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades. The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on. When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dogChop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)! GTA ONLINE: The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance. After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy). There are multiple game modes in Online, including: Free Roam - Run around with up to 32 of your closest friends (or enemies), causing chaos and other nonsense. You can also compete in mini-games, such as target practice, arm wrestling, golf, and tennis. If you don't like to be killed constantly by other players in Free Roam, you can play in Solo Mode, but you'll be unable to play game modes that require more than one player. Missions - These are given out by characters in GTAV (Lamar, Gerald, Martin, etc.), and are co-op jobs with up to 4 players. Survival - Try to survive up to ten waves of enemies with 3 other players. PVP - There are multiple subsets of this, including: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch (Free for all), Vehicle Deathmatch, Team Elimination (You only have one life.), Capture (A twist to Capture the Flag), Objective-based missions (Complete a objective, while the enemy team tries to do the same), races, and parachuting. Heists - These are my personal favourite. With up to three of your friends (friends are highly recommended, unless you want to fail the heist repeatedly), you can perform challenging and rewarding missions to obtain lots of cash and exclusive heist vehicles. Unlike basic jobs, these heists involve multiple sub-jobs within them called Heist Setups that must be completed prior to the Heist Finale. As the heist leader, you can set what crew member does what job and their pay for doing that job. Teamwork is essential because the entire team shares one extra life (or none at all if the dificulty is above normal), and if that life is expended, the current mission fails and you'll have to restart it. There are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking. So far I haven't seen any hackers, but I wouldn't doubt their existence. Final Verdict In retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a 9/10 + Amazing story + Excellent gameplay + Fun with friends, and fun without them! + Great graphics + GTA Editor + Heists are fun and replayable for more cash - Glitches ""Now go! I need to meditate. Or masturbate.

In this review, I'll be stating how ""Free to Play"" the game actually is and what the gameplay is like, what the game offers in terms of content, and a pros/cons list at the end of the review to sum things up. So first off, how Free to Play is this game anyways? As a lot of us know, most Free to Play games have you paying for microtransactions to get most content in the game, with no way of using the in-game resources or currency to get them instead. Warframe does not do this, only cosmetic items, color pallets, interior decorations for your Liset, etc. Things like Weapons, Warframes, and Companions can all be earned by playing the game and getting enough resources/credits. Although Warframe and Weapons slots can't be obtained without platinum (Warframe slots are 20 platinum each and weapon slots are 2 for 12 platinum), you can trade items in the trade channel to people in exchange for platinum. Another thing I should mention is Foundry build rushing. If you are building a weapon or Warframe in the foundry, you will notice a ""Rush build"" option. This isn't spendy though, usually only costing 25-50 platinum to do so. Trust me, if you have what people want, you can obtain a hefty amount of platinum without paying a dime and have plenty to spend on rushing builds or buying slots. Now if you actually start liking the game and want to spend money to get things quicker, this is where you could have a tough time. Market prices from Digital Extremes are, you could say, ""Extreme"". With Weapons usually costing about $5-$12 depending on the weapons and Warframes costing $5-$20 depending on the Warframe. To put this into a better perspective, it costs $5 for the most basic package of platinum, which is 75 platinum, all the way to $200 worth of platinum, which is 4300 platinum. There is a cheaper way to get platinum though. The game has a login reward system and sometimes you can get a coupon for 25%, 50%, and 75% off your next platinum purchase. This would be an ideal time to buy some. They started doing Prime Access, which allows you to access the lastest prime Warframe and weapons instantly.....for $150 of course. The cheapest package you can get in Prime Access give you just the prime accessories, a 90 day Affinity Booster, and a 90 day Credit Booster....for $50!! I feel Prime Access just isnt all that affordable, but maybe that's just me. My rating on Warframe's Free to Play factor is a 9/10. Alright, next thing to talk about is the actual gameplay. Is it fun? Is it rewarding? Well, Warframe can be very fun to play at times, other times it can be annoying and tedious to play. It's a 3rd person view Co-Op/PvP shooter with unique elements that will be talked about later. In the beginning, you will have a choice among 3 Warframes ( Excalibur, Mag, or Volt), you will have a choice between 2 primary weapons ( MK1-Braton or MK1-Paris), you will have a choice between 2 secondary weapons (Lato or MK1-Kunai), and you will have a choice between 2 melee weapons (Skana or MK1-Bo). Either of the Warframe are fun to play, in my opinion. The MK1-Braton is garbage, both secondaries are good for beginners, and both melee weapons are good for beginners as well. Getting used to some of the controls might be a pain at first (Such as wall-running and sliding), but eventualy you'll get the hang of it and be flipping around like a space ninja in no time! Basically what I'm saying here is that the beginning of the game is hard to get past, in the sense that you feel underpowered and weak compared to your foes. If stick with it long enough to get better equipment, then it becomes much more fun to play. Weapons are fun and all, but I think the Warframes are what spice the game up the most. Each Warframe has a set of 4 powers that you unlock as you rank them up. The powers are some of the most fun this game has to offer. Example scenario: You are a rank 10 Excalibur surrounded by 25 Grineer troopers and there are just too many to shoot and kill before you die yourself. What do you do at this point? Activate Radial Javelin, which is your most powerful power as Excalibur, and watch as all 25 of them are pinned to the walls around you. Eventually, you'll be able to do the same thing, but with 50 guys surrounding you. Warframe powers, yes please. Now what about rewarding gameplay? This game can reward you at times, however, it can be very grindy. The first thing you'll probably farm for in this game are resources. Resources aren't that painful to try to get, although Orokin Cells, Neurodes, Neural Sensors, and Argon Crystals are the ones you will be grinding out on the most. In terms of farming, the only real things that could be tedious to obtain are Warframe parts, Prime Warframe parts, Prime Weapon parts, and Archwing parts. Speaking of Archwing, if you have played the game awhile now and feel the need for something new to do, try getting the Odonata Archwing and fly through deep space in Archwing missions. It's a breath of fresh air if you feel like ground combat is getting boring. Gameplay can get pretty intense at times, if you finally have the loadout to survive 30 minutes on Warframe's survival gamemode or 30+ waves on Warframe's defense mode. All in all, the gameplay is fun, the farming/grinding usually isnt fun, but once you get that weapon built or Warframe built, the fun begins yet again. Overall, Warframe's gameplay gets an 8/10 from me. Now to talk about what Warframe has to offer in terms of content. Well, it has a lot of content to offer compared to when I started back in June 2013. There are 22 Warframes available to play as, not counting the Prime Warframes (Only difference is they have an extra polarity and look way cooler). There are 100+ weapons in the game as well, not to mention the primes of course. There are 14 planets to visit, each with increasing number of missions available. Tons of mods to choose from, including melee stances, which enhance your melee weapons by allowing you to perform combos. Just, plenty of content for a newcomer to explore. Every other Wednesday, Digital Extremes usually updates the game with new content, bugfixes, and changes that improve the experience of the game. Usually every two months, Digitial Extremes puts out a massive update, usually going up a whole number ( As in Update 14.5 goes to Update 15). These massive updates add hours upon hours of new things to do. Warframe's amount of content gets a 10/10 from me. Now finally, a pros/cons list to sum everything up (And some things I didnt talk about): Pros: -The game is fun to play once you get the hang of things. -Easy to learn thanks to a tutorial -PvE and PvP -You can earn content in the game without paying -Friendly community -There is a wealth of content -At least 7 gamemodes to play -Endgame is cool, more to come! -No Pay to Win business models -Rewarding exploration (Especially in Void missions) -Warframe powers are fun as hell -Most boss fights are awesome for a F2P -Alerts, Invasions, and Infestations as daily missions are great and rewarding -Most all weapons past the beginner ones are great -Pet dogs Cons: -Market pricing is a bit steep -Prime access is ridiculous -There is some farming/grinding -Some bugs still in the game a frustrating -Napalms are jerks -Beginning of the game loadouts can be tough to get past (Because of how underpowered they feel) -Higher mastery rank Tenno entering your game could ruin the experience for you -Some people in trade overprice everything ever Let me know if there's anything I could add, as this is my first review :).

Would you kindly not pay for mods however and here is why. Now we all know that modding isn't perfect and depending on the type of mod can be extremly hard and confusing to install. These mods may require .INI editing and may require patches and files such as the (Skyrim Script Extender) to run correctly and even installing these can be a pain in the backside because they may be out of date versions, Include errors and might not even work on certain hardware. This can be extremely confusing to people who don't know the In-Out's of a computer, Things such as renaming or .ZIP extracting. Now onto why i think mods may cost you a fortune: ________________________________________ Now if you have looked into the workshop you may have seen there are a few mods already up for payment. These few mods (So far that i have seen) require nothing else to experience their content. Yet But this is what will happen and (Trust me it will) Say i release a mod called ""Skyrim Graphics Overhaul"" and i put it up for purchase. It seems all fine and dandy doesn't it?

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally though you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and ""tryhardish"". Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't ""hate free"". I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more ""tryhard"". Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being ""OP"") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero ""pay to win"" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game. To put it roughly in perspective, it's like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a ""fooping idiot"" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? ""Uninstall Skyrim, noob."" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? ""Learn to play, tard."" It's like that. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine)... which is 50% of the time. Sometimes not even when you're winning. It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. But realistically, why should you even have to? Videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you can't have fun half of the time, the game isn't worth it. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're golden. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting ""a stick in the mud"" player on your team.

Over 13 years playing CS in general. In older versions of CS if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players. In this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy. Game is all about luck, not skill based like all previous versions of the game. Ranked up to DMG with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person COOP. You should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know won't troll you, regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates. The hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions, due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve. The skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone. As with all games you can trade in, this one is full of scammers. Constantly, daily trying to scam your high value items from you. Procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you don't know. This game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system, costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment. Gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run. I believe there is no regulation of this system and there's plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system. Alot of reviews have complained about cheaters. This isn't such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over VAC in the competetive section of the game, blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank. Overall the game it's self has a great system but just isn't being used to its full potential. Allocate more time and money please valve.

I will never play TF2 with you. "" But one day, one of my friends was feeling down, and he's really into TF2, so I offered to play with him. And it made him happy and not sad and that was good. Then another one of my friends told me that if I played 70 hours of TF2, he'd buy me Skyrim. I don't have my own money to buy things online with; all the money I make online goes to my friends' PayPals. So I said yes, and I started logging hours. It was slow going at first. I said to him, ""It's a good game, but I'm really bad at it. And I guess that's okay - everyone's kinda bad at it. But I'll never be like you and my other friends who play this. You won't get me addicted to TF2; I'm doing this for Skyrim."" After I got Skyrim, it became my bae and I was the clingy girlfriend. As my burning passion for being a male lizardbeast died down, I started playing TF2. Mostly because, being F2P, many of my friends played and still play it. So we played TF2. It was gradual, my downfall. But it was inevitable, and in hindsight, even predictable. I want to say I'm not addicted to TF2, but then I'd be lying, because once I played for six hours straight to achieve a score of 420 and I didn't stop 'til I hit that eight hour mark. I played TF2 for more than six in' hours, man. I could've stopped at 420. No, I could've stopped an hour or two in. And yet I didn't. I started playing TF2 regularly, sometimes for long periods of time. I won't say that that was my aforementioned 'downfall'. No, it would have to be me being around TF2 bloggers on Tumblr. I watched and learned about other fans and their interests. But let me just say. Playing TF2 is one thing. Playing TF2 often is part of that one thing. But reading and writing shipping fanfiction about TF2? Getting innocents into shipping fanfiction about TF2? Well, I wish I didn't fall into this black hole of gay, but it's too late now. I'm sorry. Play TF2. But do so carefully.

Both quite unpolished and in so much need of work. Gave Firefall the benefit of the doubt, and just loved it. I needed a change though and a good buddy of mine in Firefall, was also playing Warframe and so I asked how the game was these days. Three months later, and I am all in on this game. With Firefall having open space and more of an MMO feeling, Warframe is level based, with a mission. A big change for me, but liking it lots. You get to know the mechanisms, the frames, mods etc etc and just get better at it. Frames keep leveling, so are the mods. All these things give you a feeling of accomplisment in this game. The frames are quite distinctive, and all have their specific abilities that make you come back for more. DE is adding more features, releases frames or updated/upgraded frames (Prime) and hopefully in the near future I'd like to get more into the lore of the Tenno. Every week a live community stream and I believe every other week a dev stream as well. Both with giveaways. All in all a great game that will let you have a great time with your buddies. ps. It's certainly not p2w at all. Almost everything you want, you can get it by playing certain levels etc etc. If you do pay, that's great.

Its a basic Cops vs. Robbers but the objective for the terrioists is to plant a bomb in a certain bombsite while avoiding or killing the counter-terroists. There is also another game type where the terrioists take some hostages and the counter-terrioists must resuce the hostage and return them to the hostage zone. There is 5 different modes excluding community servers. There is Deathmatch, where u spawn randomly on a certain map and u can choose any weapon u want, in my opinion its a great way for the beginners to get started in CS:GO. Next is Arms Race which is similar to Deathmatch but u get a new gun every time u get a kill and when u got a kill with every gun, u have to kill someone with a knife which is kinda hard. Another type is Demolition which u get a new gun every kill u get but u must wait until the next round, if u get more than 1 kill, u are awarded with grenades. Casual is known as the most played mode which is technically the `actual` game which u must use the money u earn from kills and rounds to buy guns. Finally the most important one, Competetive where it is a 5v5 game however unlike Casual where u can see the enemy on the map and even watch them, u cannot see where ur enemy is unless u hear footsteps or gunshots. It is important u co-operate with ur teammates if u wanna win cause thats the most important thing in CS:GO, teamwork. As of now, there have been hackers who aim hack and shoot through walls when u cant do that normally. Many people have reported this but Valve has done nothing about it but make updates for their guns when they clearly know theres hackers and thousands of people hate it. I would give this game 10 out of 10 but since there is hackers and smurfs who pay another 15 or 7 bucks just to kill newcomers when its not fair, i give this game 7 out of 10. The reason being is hackers and smurfs take 2 away and the servers take 1 away. What i mean is that CS:GO servers randomly go bad making most people on the server have a high ping.",,3,"Sep 2, 2014, 7:22PM",0.6153846153846151,13,"{'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.6136363636363631, 'num_achievements_attained': 54}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rafsterman,8,Rafsterman,61.0,5,511.2,Rafsterman,0,Recommended,462.0,79,0,19,170,0.6539214735160037,0.52568823

Has really bad UI, very dull slow and insistent storyline, and you just end up not really caring. The side missions are a hell of a lot more fun, I never bothered with the main quest. Pretty ish, but not that great. With mods, it becomes a whole new world. You can make it look so much better, add more realistic effects, add a random start so you don't have to sit through the dull and horrible cart scene, fix the UI, add tonnes of weapons and armour, you can even fix all the bugs. (Well, most of them. There's some ones Bethesda can't be bothered with that even modders can't fix.) However, this new paid mod scheme makes me very wary of it indeed. I mentioned the stock UI being bad. The mod to fix that, which is a core component of many mods, has just become paid only. (There's an older version on the Nexus, no longer being updated.) This is a worrying trend. Modding makes this game what it is, it's just standard otherwise. If you want it, mod it for free from the nexus or workshop, and I can kind of recommend it. But Oblivion and Fallout New Vegas are still very good alternatives for modding paradise. If it wasn't for this new introduction of paying for mods, I'd put it as a positive review. But the damage this could do to the modding community is too great. Especially Bethesda games, which often rely on modders to fix their broken games.","Apr 26, 2015, 6:59AM",0,"Apr 26, 2015, 6:55AM",0.846153846153846,26,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.8787878787878781, 'num_achievements_possible': 33, 'num_achievements_attained': 29}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/timmystwin,22,timmystwin,27.0,4,22.0,One Shot No Kills,0,Not Recommended,44.0,117,0,10,271,0.6968292395927356,0.6617397

It is no secret that the fantastic success of TES games from Morrowind onward came and comes from its vibrant modding community. For almost ten years by now, modders have transformed their enthusiasm for TES games into (usually) well-crafted mods that greatly enhanced the experience of the base game. And these mods were free - they were a community thing, something which people produced because they liked the game but thought they could make it just a tad better by adding this or tweaking that. And again, they usually were right with that. Then some particularly bright heads over at Valve and Zenimax added the option to demand a price for fan mods. Even if you overlook the fact that the modder only gets 25% of the revenue his or her mods generate, this change will mean that many mods will no longer be created because the modder liked the game, but because s/he is in for a quick buck. What does that mean? 1. Essential tech mods that are required to run other (free) mods may go commercial. SkyUI, an interface mod many free mods rely on has already removed its own free version, breaking hundreds of other mods. 2. The same holds true for bugfix mods. Want to play the game without bugs? Better pay twice, once for the game itself, and once to get it to run without problems. 3. Art assets from free mods -WILL- be stolen and used in commercial mods, most likely without the consent of the original author. Valve can not possible hope to effectively regulate this, and even the original creators can not sift through dozens of different mods to see whether they are using assets created by them. 4. Developers may start to intentionally leave interesting mechanics out of the game, knowng the modding community will add them sooner or later - and that they can use this to cash in on the players twice. And that's just some of the problems paid mods will bring about. As far as Valve or Zenimax do not remove the option to create paid mods for this game, I can not and will not recommend buying it. TES Games rise and fall with the modding community, and the powers are trying to cash in on it.",,1,"Apr 27, 2015, 8:16AM",0.846153846153846,13,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.17415730337078603, 'num_achievements_possible': 178, 'num_achievements_attained': 31}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/ger_Fireeye,11,ger_Fireeye,18.0,2,501.6,Fireeye,8,Not Recommended,16.0,69,0,25,121,0.7659247454082903,0.75113267

I was not disappointed. FM15 offers quite a bit of changes; everything from the 3D matches to the interface, gameplay and responsiveness. First off, the responsiveness of the game has greatly increased and improved. The game is far more responsive than earlier versions, and seems to go 'easier' on the processor. Second, interface. The interface has been changed drastically. Anyone who has played the previous FM installments will have a hard time at first with getting to grips with this new interface, but the change is definitely for the better. It is far more intuitive and works far better for newer players - And it might take a while to get accustomed to it but once you do, you realize exactly how much of a fabulous and welcome change it is. It makes the game navigation far easier, smoother and smarter - Which, in addition to the game's responsiveness, makes for a very fluid gaming experience. The 3D matches however, are not to my liking. The cartoonish graphics and unrealistic movement of the players reminds me more of FIFA 95' than a modern game. In my eyes, this is a step back from FM14 in fact, and hinders the game somewhat as the players score unlikely and unrealistic goals sometimes, or commit some extremely unrealistic movement and the entire feel of it is just awkward. But, now, my last and most important point: Gameplay. My god has this changed. The whole game feels incredibly new, the tactics screen is much easier to navigate through, the inbox makes your life incredibly easy (With interactions with players/transfers/almost anything can be done directly from the inbox when prompted with a message about it), transfers are *far* more realistic, negotiations about contracts too, player interactions have seen a major improvement, as have interviews with the press and team talks. Heck, even the backroom advice is better! The entire ""Interaction/conversation"" section is much easier to navigate through, works far better and more fluildy and seems to have a much greater impact on the game. Players seem to interact better and more often, and their interactions have real positive or negative effects on your team and the game and that's absolutely fantastic. It's one of the major things that has been missing, proper interactions. Many people have stated that the game is unrealistic, that they lose all the time or get injured all the time - And I have one thing to say: Review your tactics. The game is *NOT* broken. I've been playing for a while now with Arsenal (The most injury stricken team ever) and I've only had two injuries so far, both of them under three weeks out for the players - And the players are extremely susceptible to injuries (Jack Wilshere and Gibbs), so it's understandable. The scores have been realistic so far as far as I'm concerned, and from what I can tell, the problems people have been having directly link to their inability to adapt to the new game interface and inability to create proper tactics. The only real thing that bothers me about this game however, is the fact that the ""Current Ability"" and ""Potential Ability"" ratings for players seems to have decreased extremely from FM14 for some odd reason, and in some places it's truly uncalled for. I mean, for example, how can it be that Alexis Sanchez's Current Ability is only 165, when he's clearly having a *much* better season than, for example, Sergio Aguero whose Current Ability is around 180? That's just ludicrous. But let's be real, I'm happy that this is the only bad thing I can say about this game (And the 3D part), I mean, that's the least of our worries. Eventually, the Football Manager series heavily relies on tactics, not on individuals, and that's what makes it great and that's also what makes this flaw really minor. I highly recommend this game and see it as a step in the right direction for SI.",,0,"Jan 26, 2015, 2:49AM",0.736111111111111,72,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/LugzanRellk,53,LugzanRellk,,19,245.8,Nazgul Killer,0,Recommended,,0,0,0,0,0.6638591222652055,0.6932596

I guess im wrong. So i started my game, the last coach had ended his career with 5 wins streak. So i felt pressured to win in the begin. Won 2 matches were my team was expected to tie. So far So good. Then i started noticing it. Next match starts. Everythings fine. My Defender is about to get the ball... Know what happens? He sundenly slows down and nearly stops walking, enemy striker gets the ball and scores. I tough it was a isolated mistake of the match engine so i continued. Next match my striker was running foward, grabbed the ball, man on man vs the keeper, he stops running and 4 defenders reach him. He can easily score from there. Does he shot? No. He tries to dribble the 4 defenders by going in the MIDDLE of them. Later i saw my striker running, he had no chance to get the ball, enemy defender did the wost pass i ever saw and fell into the ground for no real reason then started crying. My striker had a chance in front of the goal man on man. He kicks the ball slow and near the keeper and... its in?! Might be a bug. Thats when you start noticing every corner kick that is going to ANY PLAYER BUT A STRIKER near the first post will go in. Works for both sides. My Defender did a hat trick with those corners, striker had even more opportunities by the same way and didnt kick the ball. Enemy also scored like this, between my defenders leg that is. Im not opening this game again until january update,i swear to god. SI should release FM at january instead of releasing it at november every year with the match engine sloppier and sloppier.

It was in this VOID that a war raged between the glowing white people and an unknown, let's call them yellow people. In a desperate attempt to succeed, the glowing white people created magical spandex suits to contain the power of those affected by the VOID's magical glowingness. The war turned, and yet for unknown reasons the magical spandex people of the VOID turned on their former masters. Zing to the sort-of-present-in-this-universe, you play as a WARFRAME; a magical man enveloped by the most staggeringly beautiful piece of spandex to grace the seven galaxies. The magnificent contours of your spandex allows you powers beyond your wildest dreams, from jumping really high to tearing people apart with magical fire-gloves. Your magical journey through candyland starts off in a Cryotube getting ravenously bullied by blue crab-people named GRINEER; one of the 3 warring factions in this ed-up universe, comprised of clones that wear really stupid armor. In self defense, you gracefully tear the crab-people into tiny gibs and escape into your own personal ship named the LISET, accompanied by a really annoying voice named ORDIS. Your adventure continues through the black  expanse of space to further terrorize the crab-people of Earth, and rescue DARVO, tied to the CORPUS; s who care only about money and wear 80s spacesuits designed for really wierd fetish porn. After escaping the grasp of the crab-people and spacemen, the rest of the story falls into your hands, the sentience behind the spandex. Only you can write your own destiny, tell your own story, spin your own tale. Go forth, spandexman, and bring forth with you wrath the likes of which never graced by this generation, nor will ever be for generations to come.

New features, player updates, ""great match engine"" etc. What could go wrong? Lots. The ""match engine"" is pathetic. Thats the only word for it. Heres why: Keepers constantly spill the ball onto opposition players. Midfield just stand off and stand off, no tackles made. Just run up, stop, watch the player run past. Regardless of what tactics you use (i.e close down more, harder tackling etc). The amount of goals conceded by corners or long range wondergoals is a joke. Im in the Scottish Premiership right now, theres no way my team should be conceding the types of goals they have been.

Warframe,1.8,9.0,http://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/homecontent/?userreviewsoffset=20&p=1&itemspage=3&screenshotspage=3&videospage=3&artpage=3&allguidepage=3&webguidepage=3&integratedguidepage=3&discussionspage=3&appid=230410&appHubSubSection=10&appHubSubSection=10&l=english&browsefilter=toprated&filterLanguage=default&searchText=&forceanon=1,11.0,http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/230410/,0,"Warframe's relaxed take on third person combat, impressive visuals, and vast combat customization lets it appeal to both hardcore gamers as well as weekend warriors. Latency issues and high system requirements can put off many but its free to play model is fair. All of the content is provided to players free of charge and that makes it difficult not to recommend it to everyone. You assume the role of one of the Tenno; an ancient group of warriors that were placed in cryogenic stasis in order to survive a losing war.Your character then awakens to find the solar system in extreme turmoil. Caught in a war between three major factions and being the only ones able to disrupt the stalemate, they soon attract attention. Awoken and lead by a mysterious identity going by the alias Lotus the Tenno's intentions continue to remain unknown. Warframe's third person combat is simple but refined, providing a very relaxed and smooth shoot-'em-up feel, while a complex but easy to follow weapon modification system offers endless customization to the gameplay. Enemies will drop many modifications during missions, which allow players to change weaponry and their character to improve combat performance without limitation. This design allows players to modify all of the smallest aspects of their character and weaponry while maintaining the games RPG elements. Each of the weapons have their own specific function, attack patterns and style, which further compliment your playstyle. Dying can come across as cheap as some enemies will stun lock players to death or simply hit through their shields for an instant-kill. Included to increase difficulty; it often feels unjustified and overly punishing. Mission maps are generated randomly based on pre-existing tile sets depending on the planet and type of mission chosen. Each mission has a specific objective, however many of these feel overly similar; often consisting of back tracking and repetitive fetch quests. Missions are unlocked by completing the adjacent nodes connected to them; however this soon branches off into many directions, though many of these use the same tile-sets as the previous mission with only a few varying objectives between the two. Missions can often feel too similar to one another on a single planet, giving little reason to play ones that branch away from the main path. The matchmaking system can be frustrating, offering little choice in terms of selecting a mission or joining a game already in progress. Offering no options besides public or private, you may often find yourself leaving a laggy game only to be thrown back in again numerous times. The matchmaking system definitely needs work and its constantly overlooked throughout updates. Warframe's free to play model uses micro-transactions to speed up the acquisition of weapons and characters with the use of in game currency called platinum. Free users are still able to access all content within the game but will struggle to gain access to everything without consistent farming for materials and parts needed to create new weapons. Platinum allows players to directly purchase weapons and characters without the need to craft and collect materials. With free players able to access all content while giving paying customers faster access to new content, Warframe shows how the free to play model doesnt have to alienate non-paying users. While Warframe doesn't provide the adrenaline fueled action we're accustomed to in shooters, its Shoot-'em-up style combat remains satisfying for many hours and the endless customization options add much needed padding to help overcome the repetition. The heavy reliance on a random loot table for item drops throughout the game can lead to extreme frustration at times, especially when farming for a specific item. Bugs can be prominent at times, especially the ones that affect the user interface, however most major issues are fixed quickly with a hotfix provided by the development team. Pros: + Stunning visuals, especially for more powerful video cards + Plenty of weapons and characters to level up + Customization allows any type of design and play-style which adds replay value + Frequent content updates Cons: - Dying can feel unfair at times, leaving the player stun-locked until death - Matchmaking system needs work, often selecting poor hosts - High repetition within missions - High system requirements - Microtransactions are a little overpriced While rough around the edges at times, most bugs and technical issues are not persistent. As long as you can meet the system requirements and bandwidth isn't a limitation, theres no reason not to give Warframe a try with its fair free to play model.

Well, for starters. this game has everything to offer due to its unbelieveable amount of mods and mod authors, you want to blow things up? Go download a c4 charge and plant it in a fully destructable building if your computer can handle it. Want to watch youtube videos in a theatre? Go to a Gmod theatre server. Want to live a life in a game? Go to a RP server. Want to roam around a nuclear wasteland filled with zombies and bandits? Go to a dayz server or another end-of-the-world server. Want to play sherlock holmes and find the traitor among the innocent? Or be said traitor? Find a TTT server. My point is, you want something? there's probably a mod for that. If you have a friend that can play with you on a LAN server or just a private server, get creative in sandbox. you could make something, you could create scenarios, you could pose some ragdolls for some funny or gruesome screenshots, or even just send armies of rebels against two antlion guards. The choice is yours! Overall, this game gets an 8 out of ten from me The mod is the limit in this game, but unless you have friends. The servers can be hostile. (especially the TTT and DarkRP servers, you can get pretty paranoid in TTT ) And singleplayer is only so much fun, you really need to be creative to find fun in singleplayer. I'm a bit on the un-creative side so give the game a try yourself, just make sure to bring a friend.","Jan 28, 2014, 9:36AM",0,"Jun 11, 2013, 12:14AM",0.8886792452830181,530,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.6467065868263471, 'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_attained': 108}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/MASH-4077,471,MASH-4077,15.0,59,313.7,The Sergeant | FT,1,Recommended,15.0,59,2,9,59,0.7200599556531826,0.7728901

Delayed for months on end for what only the most optimistic of people could assume was to release a functioning game. But aside from the day one issues of the game not launching if you happen to have an odd pc username or integrated graphics card, and you managed to get into the game, you were met with loading screen after loading screen. Finally after 10 minutes of being juggled between single player and online mode, and you finally manage to get into the same session with your friends, you were cruelly separated again by multiple loading screens after completing a job. But aside from the horrible way the game tosses you around from loading screen to loading screen you still have to deal with the 1000+ minor annoyances in the game left behind from its console counterparts. Like the god awful weapon wheel. Perfectly fine on a controller and a must when dealing with more than 2 weapons. but a ing nightmare on pc. Oh hey want to use your favorite pistol? Hold tab, awkwardly move your mouse around, and then scroll wheel for 5 seconds. Need to heal with a snack or put on some armor? hit your ""Quick menu"" and navigate through several sub-menus to get to them. God forbid you give pc users, who are playing on devices with more than 10 buttons, the ability to bind one of those buttons to quickly heal or equip armor. Oh and the lovely peer to peer hosting, no better way for someone from Scottland to meet a couple aussies, or bring an American and a bunch of Europeans together on a roller coaster shouting into their mics for bonus rp. You know the best part of pc gaming for game developers? you don't even need to host your own game servers, thousands of people will literally spend hundreds of dollars paying for their own servers, that make the experience infinitely better. But we were left to suffer through the atrocity that is p2p and all the fun things it brought, like cheaters. Just as swiftly as modding came for single player, cheaters came for online. For weeks GTA Online was filled with people running around in god mode, causing havoc, spawning things inside of others garages, and running suicide scripts on the sad participants in their lobby. But Rockstar did finally bring an end to the hacker madness with a huge ban wave that felt no need to discriminate. For the script kiddies sprinting down the street as invincible monkeys with their explosive gatling guns, received the same punishment as those who we're caught in a money storm as bags of cash fell on them spawned in from another person. 2/10 Bite me","May 5, 2015, 5:03AM",0,"May 5, 2015, 4:57AM",0.5750000000000001,40,"{'num_achievements_possible': 21, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.047619047619047006, 'num_achievements_attained': 1}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperChurro,23,SuperChurro,13.0,17,198.6,spooky skele,0,Not Recommended,7.0,71,0,2,122,0.7012352169356341,0.68917364

Ninjas. I shouldn't have to say anything more. Fair warning: If you're not willing to spend a LONG time playing this game, you'll find your options kind of limited. You start with 2 character slots, 6 weapon slots and 50 plat, 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots. You'll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots, as everything else is a waste. Getting more plat costs money and I highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat, log into the game every day and wait for the 75% discount to show up. With the discount, a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you don't care about having all the weapons. If you want to collect ALL the weapons, you'll probably want to spend $50 and go for the 3000 plat option. The mod grind (collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons) can take a stinking long time to work through, but if you can have fun doing it (after all, it just means playing the game a lot), you'll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at. Good mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets, but everyone's usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked. I'd say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content. It can be really difficult to get a group for that one mission you need to unlock the other mission you need to unlock the mission that unlocks the next planet you want to get to to work your way towards that boss that drops the parts you need to make the warframe (class) you wanted a week ago and still haven't reached.

Now that the game is a stable release, this may not be a problem anymore, but it left a strong sour taste in my mouth. Even with this fact aside, it takes an extraordinary amount of time and luck to get better gear/items. In many games, you get small stat increases at relatively frequent intervals, or relatively frequent gear drops. Although I think the weapons are supposed to be sidegrades, the expensive and high-rank weapons are much better, albeit somewhat more situational, than the defaults.

The developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game. They keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom Real Virtuality engine rather than replacing it, as well as adding new campaigns, missions, vehicles, weapons, and game modes. The part where this game REALLY shines, however, is the community driven mods. The game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make ANYTHING they want out of this game. It may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page, but I've seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims, ""grand theft auto"" like games (Arma Life), hardcore zombie games (DayZ), a StarGate tribute which had working, animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show, ww2 sims (Invasion 1944), Jurassic Park tributes, and so much more. These mods take a lot of work to create, sure, but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing. Simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down. Now add some waypoints for them to attack a town. Add some soldiers inside the town. That's it! If you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers, using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy. This all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on. Want to do more? Read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it you'll have the ability to make suicide bombers, ""battle busses"" (essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it), nuclear bombs, and really ANYTHING you can imagine. If you have any issues, someone will be willing to help you out either on reddit.com/r/armadev or on the official Bohemia Interactive forums. I hope you'll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or I just freshly made in the editor! Even if you don't like making your own content, there are fun mods already out there such as the popular Battle Royale mod where you're forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear. Just look around and you'll find endless entertainment in this game! THE BAD --------------- I mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced. This does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games, but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs. Another warning I would give would-be buyers is that the game is very demanding for your PC. People who have rigs that they THINK are powerful because they can play Battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise: Arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware. At the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples' hardware, even when pretty impressive, just doesn't get along with the game that well at the moment.","Jun 23, 2014, 12:27PM",0,"Jun 23, 2014, 11:58AM",0.846153846153846,26,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/trenchninja,22,trenchninja,,4,487.2,TrenchNinja,0,Recommended,,0,1,0,0,0.7304570407566554,0.75981003

I have played football manager since 2012 and know the game in and out. Now this is the most fun football manager. But is the most fake as in a season only having one 0-0 game where I play defence with counter attack still does make for an interesting season. Having 127 goals and 58 conceded is interesting to watch as well do not get me wrong. But this is the most unrealistic football manager they have put out. Its a joke how many goals go in and how much is just plain unrealistic. Example first game in the Prem just got Middlesbrough promoted playing against Liverpool games ends 8-6 .... 8-6 !!! How does that happen? If you want an unreal intense football manager where it is all GOALS GOALS GOALS then this is for you if you want a football manager go and play the last year and just download a MOD that updates teams for you because this is not a football manager. Pros  - A lot of goals - Never a dull game - More in-depth communication with player and staff - In match team talks - Better transfer and overall balancing - Always fun most game end with a min of 3 goals - MORE GOALS GOALS !!! GOALS FOR EVERY ONE - Being able to speak to a player who does not want to come instead of being blocked by agent gives more scope to get players out of your range Cons  - Very unrealistic - Random injurie spells (not always but can end up having 9 players out for 3 weeks after 2 games and two weeks of training) So always save and quit when this starts as when it does the injuries will not stop until you cannot field a team - No matter strategy you will score a lot and concede a lot - Could still have more depth, I still think it has got too streamlined from 2012 - Players seems to get very unhappy fast and all seem to being a stubborn as a mule unless you use the talk ( X player is having good form) no matter the form they seem to agree with you - Having a one 0-0 in a hole season and 3 strikers with more than 20 goals and top 6 goals scores in the league all having more the 30 goals kind of makes it seem very unrealistic - German league rights have gone and still no badges for most top flights teams ( MODS do fix both mind) Overall For people wanting fun 7/10 People wanting a football manager 3/10",,0,"Jan 3, 2015, 5:19AM",0.7814569536423841,151,"{'num_achievements_attained': 35, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.33333333333333304, 'num_achievements_possible': 105}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/stozer,118,stozer,7.0,33,117.5,chris_stoz,0,Not Recommended,7.0,0,0,2,106,0.6957685793769144,0.6287055

I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking ""It can't be that bad"". After almost two months of playing, I can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. Perhaps worse. The first few weeks the liking was soft, I liked the game, the ""Meet the"" videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but I was extremely bad at first, ""15 kills, 10 deaths"" type of bad. I dominated just one player every two rounds; and I even got really excited when I got a revenge (Jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). That's how bad, and even n00by I was. I was coming back to online PC gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. But then, when I started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when I'd become friends with my pocket Medics or the people I was a pocket Medic to... Life changed. This game literally consumed me. I wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my Medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and I ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. I'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. Now it's gotten to the point in which I've played 12 hours straight of TF2 with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. With a lot of effort I got up my  to work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because I wanted to play. The game's just special like that, ya'know? It's fun. It's unique, creative. And I love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when they're shooting or fighting, the happy faces on the partner-taunts, the faces of agony when they're with low health; details like that make it special. And it's just generally very addictive. My point? This game is f*cking terrible. I don't give a cr*p if it's free, DON'T INSTALL IT. IT WILL CONSUME YOU AND RUIN YOU. F*CKING RUN.

May take some time to fix it -- campaign saves may be corrupted after an update - takes time to learn the basics - desync on multiplayer (which is a server/player issue, no Arma 3 issue) - vehicle physics/collisions (Hunter can move HEMTT etc.) ?? Karts DLC Gameplay Arma 3 is a tactical military/war/combat simulation. You control a soldier on 2 huge maps: Stratis and Altis. Once you get used to the keybindings (there are a lot!) there's nothing that can stop you. If you prefer slow and realistic combat over fast FPSs (such as CS, CoD or BF) it's definitely worth checking out. Arma 3 does not offer a ranking system (some servers do) and you need to check your surroundings before you start shooting someone. Otherwise you'll end up unconscious in the middle of nowhere. Scenarios - Single Player Main Campaign: Arma 3 offers a great campaign with an interesting story line. You're playing as NATO soldier Cpl Kerry. The main campaign is split into 3 chapters/episodes: ""Survive"", ""Adapt"" and ""Win"". In the first chapter you need to survive in a multi-force conflict on Stratis. It's a quite instructive Episode, showing you the Arma 3 101s, such as moving, diving, driving, shooting etc. There's no pop-up message showing you what to do, but usually you can open a ""Help"" tab by pressing H. The missions on Survive are quite controlled, but if you keep hiding behind a rock your Squad Members will have a hard time or even die. So if you don't want to be left alone, you should do what you're supposed to. The second Episode plays on Altis, where you join a local Guerilla force. In this chapter you learn how to control your own squad and how the communication system works. You still have your orders, but you can leave the base and explore the map whenever you want, playing optional missions or looking for better weapons. Finally, in ""Win"" you join the NATO reinforcment. In this chapter you need to show what you've learned so far, fighting a lot of enemies ;-) Scenarios - Workshop / SP / COOP The Steam Workshop offers a lot of user created content, which you should definitely check out. Many of them can be played in coop with friends or even on servers. There are some stock Arma 3 coop missions you can play as well. Scenarios - Multiplayer There are a lot of Servers online, which offer a lot of different scenarios and modifications. I'll cover just a few (popular) of them: Domination: Basically ""King of the Hill"" where you need to capture cities. Usually you can use whatever gear you want and choose your function (Engineer, Medic, Commander, ...). Every function has its own abilities, which you can benefit from. Most servers also support side missions, where you can get new vehicles, choppers or jets. Domination's my personal favourite. Wasteland: It's a team deathmatch mode where you can join multiple groups or play on your own. You usually start with a pistol and need to find/buy weapons and supplies (water, food, ..) to survive. If you earned enough money you can build your personal fort. There are vehicles and choppers on the map, but most of them are broken and you need to repair/refuel them. But you can also get special vehicles for your team by doing side missions which appear every few minutes. Certainly, the other teams try to do the same thing. Altis Life: One of the most popular game modes. It's basically a ""cops and robbers""/""roleplay"" simulation. There are police forces which are other players controlling the cities. As long as you don't do anything illegal, such as killing someone or carry weed with you, they won't do anything to you. It's a fun mode if you want to play Arma without shooting someone all the time. Microphone is recommended! Scenarios - Do it yourself! You certainly can host your own server. There are a lot of scenarios which you can download and modify. Arma 3 also offers you an Editor which you can use to build your own scenario from scratch. It's quite hard if you don't know anything about scripting or never used the Arma editor before, but there are a lot of tutorials on youtube and on forums which you can check out. Kart DLC There's not much I can tell about the DLC, but you can drive Karts, Yay! Known issues A lot of people are not able to play Arma 3 on a stable framerate, despite their superior machine. If you have any performance issues, check out the online tutorials on how to fix it. There are a lot of possible ways to increase your performance. But worth the money? Imho, definitely! It's been over a year and the devs still add content. Check out videos on youtube or try the game on free weekends if you're interested but don't know if it's something for you. It takes some time to learn the basics, don't be frustrated if you die every minute on your first try ;-)",,0,"Oct 26, 2014, 7:32PM",0.861244019138756,209,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.08, 'num_achievements_attained': 2, 'num_achievements_possible': 25}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychonauter,180,psychonauter,32.0,29,303.7,Psychonaut,0,Recommended,53.0,2,0,4,139,0.6663338942850089,0.8405279

You might think, just by looking at its store page with the ""Free to Play"" tag and the ""dlc(?)"" packs underneath that it's Pay to Win. That is not the case. Not even a little bit. You can obtain everything non-cosmetic in the game without paying a dime. You can even trade rare items for the in-game currency, platinum. So you really can get everything without paying. You start off with little, taking a weapon of choice for a Primary, Secondary and a Melee weapon, as well as one of three Warframes. Your Warframe has certain abilities that set it aside from others. As you master your weapons and Warframe, The Lotus takes notice and allows you to test your abilities and Rank Up. After you've ranked up, you now have access to better weaponry to take on bigger things. The mission variety is good, the amount of weapons can be overwhelming, but there's always something to do. Give this game a shot.

It's hard to get into when you have never palyed Arma II. The graphics are amazing. There are multiple different scenarios to play if you dont feel like playing multiplayer. But I would say multiplayer is where the game is at its best. It may take some time to get into the action which is where the Arma 3 fails at, but once you are in the heat of battle the gameplay is unmatched by anyhting else. Communicating with squad mates, tactically moving about to achieve the objective, and the feeling of being in huge squad is just something no other game in my opinion has achieved. If you are interested in Arma 3 then I recommend you buy it. Although I don't have much time in Arma 3, and I have played many other FPS, I can clearly say that this is one of the better FPS out there.

Negatives: Poor mission design which are scriptfests that don't offer any freedom, Ridiculously Easy, A few mechanics which dumb the game down insanely. Grand Theft Auto returns in the same fashion it left off, an open world action game that gives the player freedom to do as they please throughout the city inbetween completing missions given to you by various characters. GTA 5 is an absolute spectacle, this is the first modern game that has impressed me technologically wise, it looks great and plays great, the world feels alive and the audio is done incredibly well. It is also really well optimized, my pc is fairly old and I get stable framerates on ultra settings. GTA 5 offers an incredibly strong narrative, brilliant characters that are voiced amazingly well and a story which is similar to that of an over the top, large budget action film, the gameplay hasn't changed much at all besides for being able to switch between characters on the fly which makes for some pretty interesting gun fights later in the game. In GTA 5 there is an awesome selection of weapons to use which are also modifiable allowing you to add attachments such as silencers, better scopes, flashlights and upgrading the magazine capacity and accuracy. Staying true to the series, GTA V is pretty much a satire of modern America which involves stereotypes and pointing fun at different organizations and people, people who get offended easily may not appreciate the humour this game offers as it is pretty remorseless. The multiplayer is great fun, along with TDM, Races etc you're able to carry out missions with other players such as heists. They're not too challenging but pretty fun when you have a team of people who know what they're doing. While GTA V is generally a good game, I don't think I've ever played a game as easy as it, there is absolutely no challenge at all in the campaign, none, and any difficulty this game could've had is taken away by constant checkpoints through missions, super powers your characters possess such as being able to slow down time and your life regenerating to a point. I also didn't like the way the missions played out, they're pretty much on rails, unlike GTA 3 and Vice City which allowed you to complete lots of missions in anyway you pleased, this just has some cutscene of your character clumsily walking into a combat sequence then you having to take out all the enemies, steal the car etc instead of being able to use the games massive world and approach the combat situations how you please, that was a massive part of what made the earlier installments of the series really fun. Overall this is an okay game which could've been a whole lot better had they focussed less on cinematics and scripted events and put more effort into making clever mission design and not adding in a few mechanics which make this extremely easy ride even easier. I can't recommend this, as polished as the game is and how brilliant the writing is the missions are inexcusably easy and offer no freedom, while a much better game than GTA 4 this still comes no where near the original games.","Apr 29, 2015, 3:15AM",0,"Apr 29, 2015, 2:37AM",0.6184210526315791,76,"{'num_achievements_possible': 35, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.08571428571428501, 'num_achievements_attained': 3}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Accept777,47,Accept777,13.0,29,83.4,Accept,1,Not Recommended,190.0,634,21,67,517,0.744230458787684,0.7401289

And because Icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the EU servers turning to s'hit because of russians, who select english on purpose because their own servers on East is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games, talking smack all the time. Now don't misunderstand, this is a great game with huge potential. But the truth of it is it's rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community. Main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows: 1# Russians ruining games, talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language. In case anyone hasn't noticed dota is a team game. 2# Solo queue has been removed(this means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone) 3# No real community Q&A support from developers, and complete ignorance on the game dev forum, mods deleting posts that's not deemed ""worthy"" even though there is issues surrounding the topics. 4# Ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal MM, the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes, It viritually means nothing when most MMR's you are still playing with complete '. 5# Broken Solo-Queue. At times, matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together, you will often or not(depending on your luck) you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game, while your team is just 2+2+1 or just all solo players. This creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match. Now Valve, has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix Dota 2's blatant community issues? Is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a non-inflammatory way? It's shameful considering how much of a profit you're making on it. At least you'd have the dignity to give us something back no? I've personally almost quit this game two times because I can't handle the community and players I am matched with constantly, they don't speak my language, share my mindset or my skill level the least, except an actual good match on some occations.

This was a difficult decision, but none the less my career will be full of adventure and creativity im sure. Journal Entry 2 I stumble upon a small village in the middle of a lush green valley. The town is very cute and has lots of character, The trees lay down gently caressing the mossy roofs of the residents old homes. There is a quiet calm stream the flows through the center of town. yes.... this is my ideal place to begin my career. Journal Entry 3 I start by scanning out the town guard's positions, from what I can tell there are only 3 of them. With such a small town who would ever think to need more guards?.... perfect... Now we just need to carefully pick our victim. I scan around, I see a few older ladies, a few older men, A boy walking with his dog.... But who do I choose? ... so many choices Journal Entry 4 While scanning the small crowd of residents I hear a women's voice from behind me say some type of vulgar insult about my clothing. I turn around to see a ugly women with a sneer on her face. She sticks her nose in the air and shoves passed me. I can hear her mumbling something else as she walks away but can't quite make it out. I think we found our first victim :) Journal Entry 5 I decided to quietly follow her, she goes to the market and picks out fruits and meats, she wanders over to the stream and glances at it for awhile, she makes small chit chat with another women. Finally she starts walking out of town down the road for a ways. I quietly take cover in the forest and sneak along. She leads me to what appears to be a small mill on the edge of town. She walks into the older looking home next to the mill. Its still daylight and I don't want to risk an attack that she can escape from... better wait till night. Journal Entry 6 I wait until about 1am, its pitch black out and all seems quiet.... time to get a closer look at her home. I lockpick the door and sneak inside. The walls are decorated with all manner of animal heads, swords and shields. She has the fire lit and the light from it bounces off all the corners of the room. I find her quietly sleeping on a bed in the corner, I pull my dagger from my cloak and raise it. With one mighty stab she gives out her last breath and sprawls out silently on the bed. Now to leave my mark, earlier on I purchased a small quantity of blue flowers from a market, this will indeed be my insignia. I position her arms so that they are across her stomach, I then gently place the blue flower in her chest. A respectful position and a perfect mark for my career. Journal entry 7 I have cleared out most of the valuable items in the house....*Door slams*.... ""OH NO"" I hear shout from behind me! Its the husband! I should have done my research better, I should have noticed the large pair of boots next to her bed, they were far to big for her... How could I be so stupid. The man turns and runs out the door... I'm going to have to catch him or else im done for. I give chase, as I burst out of the door I can see that he will get to town far before I can catch him with my dagger. I pull my bow out, im only going to get one shot, if I miss im going to have to make a run for it. I take a deep breath and steady my aim, I carefully pitch my bow up and down... trying to gauge his distance as he runs. I release my arrow, it sails gracefully through the air... then I lose sight of it....Did I miss??.. I wait...Horrfied... hoping... begging.... I see his body fall face first to the ground, a perfect shot, a perfect kill. Journal Entry 8 I quickly run over to the mans body, we are now only about 20 feet from town but luckily there are no guards walking by yet. I grab hold of the body and drag it into the woods. I decide that maybe its time that the guards know they are not in control anymore. I drag the body to the mouth of the stream that flows into the town. I pull him into the water and let go, the stream's current is weak but its enough to float him into the town. I proudly strut into town to await his body's arrival, the guards are all gathered around the center of town with lit torches talking. I wait patiently beside the market.... then I hear one of the guards yell ""A Body!"" The guards and 2 other residents run over to investigate, gasps and mumbling begin to develop around the group. I turn away and start heading out of the town.... My work is done here... Many more towns to visit in skyrim :) ========== Video Reviews ========== Oculus Playthrough http://youtu.be/Xqbozfvp4Os Playthrough http://youtu.be/zfdaAJMduTY ================ First Day Reviews Links ================ Youtube https://www.youtube.com/fdreviews Facebook https://www.facebook.com/fdreviews Twitter https://twitter.com/FirstDayReviews Steam Group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/firstdayreviews Twitch http://www.twitch.tv/firstdayreviews","Nov 5, 2014, 5:38PM",0,"Jun 1, 2014, 1:09PM",0.7596899224806201,129,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.3125, 'num_achievements_possible': 16, 'num_achievements_attained': 5}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/firstdayreviews,98,firstdayreviews,28.0,31,33.6,First Day Reviews,0,Recommended,4.0,45,6,65,392,0.806323643244977,0.798722

Lack of guaranteed long term support means that if any patch comes along that breaks it, unless the original modder comes along and fixes it, its pretty much wasted money. This may not even be possible. For something like a dota item, you have a reasonable expectation that the item will work even years later. You dont have this expectation for mods. EDIT: I stand corrected, the dota 2 arcanas have apparently been bugged for years. ing seriously, that's sad. Lack of guaranteed compatibility means any mod you buy might clash with any other mod, effectively wasting your money. Ive encountered mods that take longer than 24 hours to figure out that they dont work together, so the refund in steam dollars doesnt help. (Again) with a dota item, you have the reasonable expectation that the game will still work even with any combination of them. Increased proliferation of cashgrab mods has already been seen. The poster child for the paid mods scheme, the Shadow Scale Set, is a single piece of armour, and requires that you add it via CONSOLE. No quest, no recipe, its not even located in the world. Its also only modelled for male characters, and stretches oddly on females. I could go on, as a lot of the items immediately released are little better. Theres probably other problems I havent thought of, but even at first glance this seems like a terrible idea. EDIT 2: With the removal of paid mods, this review is no longer very relevant.

The game is getting better (especially with the Marksman DLC - Deployable bipods and weapon resting make combat so much better) - but my previous comment stands. I can not justify to anyone who has not played it before at this price. This is a game to pick up on a steam sale & its DLC. My recommendation - do not purchase it until then, unless you are desperately in need of this game. EDIT2: As fair warning - I will be deleting posts that personally attack anyone. This is for talking about ArmA3, not how stupid people are. I will delete your post if it is just an emotional response. Thank you. After 1752 hours of gameplay, 3 created mods, and thousands of written code, I can safely say that ArmA 3 is an incomplete game in its vanilla state. I am speaking from a standpoint of someone who has been with the ArmA series for a long time. I expected more from ArmA 3 and I am dissapointed by its current state. The Bohemia team is fantastic at post-launch support and I am glad to see that they are still loving this baby. There are several things that still dissapoint me about the ArmA series that I was hoping to have improved in ArmA 3. When ArmA clicks, it is an amazing experience that you can NOT get anywhere else. However, this does not mean I am blind to its downfalls - and what I was hoping to see improved upon in this series. 1)Confusing/Complicated interactions Now. I am not saying you can't learn these over time. ArmA has a difficult learning curve that is a little unncessary. The interface is just awful. ""Want to look through your rifle scope? Click the right mouse button. No. Click it. Dont hold it. That makes your view zoom in and youll hold your breath. Oh, damn. Did you control-click earlier? Yup. That swapped your scope to the little red dot sight on top. Right click to get back to the regular view. Now you can control-click to move the view youll bring up from the dot sight to the scope. Yes, I know theres no way for you to know what view youll bring up before you right click."" - http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/09/25/arma-iii-pushes-boundaries-combined-arms-warfare-patience/ 2) AI performance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRfhW-g7-zs The AI are almost brain dead at times. I don't expect anything near perfection - but why do AI have to have hack shotting skills to present a challenge? AI still lack basic abilities to effectively communicate and move properly. The AI also are way more costly on CPU then they need to be - While looking at the AI's code ( I can post pictures if you'd like ) a good chunk of their FSM's have been deactivated for quite some time. When is this going to be fixed? In a recent patch, Bohemia added AI supression. IN A RECENT PATCH. This is ArmA 3. A Military Simulator. Where suppression did not exist until recently. Even with supression AI will only look for cover if it is in within 10 meters. Otherwise they will just lay down in an open field and either 1) Shoot you directly in the face or 2) Wait to die. AI do not work well in teams and do not coordinate well in combined arms situations. APCs/helicopters/infantry can look cool when they work together but it is usually a scripted event or a random chance event. (AI will not call artillery to help them, helicopters will spot enemies but not report it to friendly AI so they can be aware of an ambush, and etc) The AI is the bare minimum and leaves more to be desired. =================================== I could only recommend this game if it was ~25-30 dollars. The game is missing a lot of promised features - but it's okay, you can get a fraction of them by paying ANOTHER 15 dollars to get the DLC they released. The DLC which has a whopping 2 helicopters. Yay. This games success is built by the community and I view ArmA 3 as nothing but a platform in which to create things - like lego. The AI is terrible. The lack of content is terrible. The developers woud rather release ""new V3S's"" for DayZ. ArmA 3 has a better engine than ArmA 2 - but lacks everything else. The DLC is helping out with the content problems...but only if you're willing to pay for what SHOULD HAVE been there. I honestly don't know what more to say...If you're on the fence about purchasing ArmA 3 and don't have a group to play with - I would not purchase this game until it goes on sale. tldr: When this game goes on sale for 10 dollars, buy it and it's dlc.

Still as super addictive as the rest of the franchise with a few new twists.... Lots of DLCs to waste your money on too!"" Fast forward to 2014, with more than a few hundred hours played under my belt, the game is officially complete with multiple small DLCs & balance/fix patches plus the 2012 & 2013 feature expansions in Gods & Kings and Brave New World which have significantly changed the gameplay. There are now a massive number of civilizations to choose too, not to mention a massive number of tailored scenarios to challenge you! The major expansions particularly, have really rounded the game off nicely, reintroducing many of the earlier missed features from Civ IV. Introduced more new things like world congress, advanced trade routes, tourism & cultural 'Great Works' to complement previously missing features like Religion & Espionage. Along with this content there was also balancing out all civilization victory paths providing some unique gameplay options to explore. There remains a more simplified approach to all of this, streamlining many features meaning less micro management. This does make the game more accessible to newer players, but in some ways feels perhaps too simplified now. It would have been good to still have more advanced micro management for those that are up to the challenge. Although more simplified game design, you will find more things to keep you busy. More end game content for example to cover those dull periods where things become stagnent. Then there is off course the huge number of achievements to unlock, many of which offer a true challenge (and sometimes a bit of luck!). Overall, even 4 years on from my first game, it is a game I always end up going back to. That is rare in the current generation of disposable gaming. It is the most enjoyable & rewarding strategy game around bar none!

I purchased it in Alpha and I was completely unaware of the amount of gameplay possibilites! You can go all out and re-create a real life scenario with the simplified editor layout, you could role-play on one of many open world servers, or you could just jump on a CO-OP server and use teamwork to destroy your enemy.. I had never played an Arma game until now and I have no regrets whatsoever for purchasing Arma 3 in Alpha and watching the game progress as it has. You would be a fool to not buy this game during any type of sale!!! The reason I really love this game is because it incorporates three of my favorite games from ""years ago"". Those games being ""Choplifter"", Arma 3 has an AMAZING 3D Version with so many more options and settings and you can carry actual players and fuel/damage/ammo...ah, so good. The first game I played, some guy was screaming at me to get in the chopper, and as we arrived to the LZ I heard the pilot say, ""Good Luck guys"", and I was completely blown away!! I thought that it was an AI pilot! The second, ""Black Hawk Down"" for pc from like 99', the PVP is so much similar but way better. Last but not least, ""Battlezone2"", that was my favorite game of all time as a kid with custom base building and defending your base. I recommend finding a community as soon as you get into Arma 3, you will instantly become immersed into the game with a full community of people from all around the world. Arma 3 is a great action packed shooter with lot of simulation aspects, a ton of different gamplay styles and gametypes, and a great place to make friends that will take you to a new level in the Steam community.

That's it. The game itself is heavily flawed and buggy. Bohemia Interactive's strategy is to exploit the lack of moddable shooters by releasing a half- game and letting the modding community fix it. Sure, there will be some great mods for the game but their success shouldn't be attributed to Arma. Games like Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 2, and the Half-Life series were hugely popular due to all the great mods made for them. But the games themselves, without mods, were actually competent. With the shift to catering towards console gamers, modding support has fell by the wayside, and Arma, perhaps unintentionally, fills that gap.

But I guess we have to take our online fun with our friends seriously because stock markets and houses and stuff. I miss being able to do all the silly things online with people like the carmageddon mod or the LCPDFR mod where you could be police and arrest people.

I appreciate the great work behind GTA V as it is, in a number of ways, better than GTA IV. With superior stability and performance as well as more to do and a bigger, more varied world to mess around in. No more do you find yourself trapped in nothing but a reasonably sized city.

Frankly though, there's not much I need to say since most of us already know what GTA is, so I'll just give a break down of what I think about the game so far on my rig. So first of all I am running an i5 3570K Processor at stock with turbo enabled, along with a GTX 760 video card with 2 gigs vram and 8 gigs of installed RAM. I must say to Rockstar, excellent job on optimising this game for PC, but the graphics to me were overhyped. Graphics are nice at 1080p, but when I compare the graphics of GTA V PC to Watch_Dogs PC with similar settings I must give Watch_Dogs the win for this one in terms of graphics, but Watch_Dogs was not optimised so that might explain why they dumbed down GTA V's graphics. The presentation of this game is as top notch as expected and the first few minutes I've been playing I am really feeling this game. The driving is OK, but takes some getting used to.

I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world. **10/10 buy** Great gift for kids! (EDIT March 29, 2014) Your comments make me lol. I might as well make a legit review. Yes I bought this game for only $2.50 but if you ask me, It is so much more worth it. It may not be the most graphical intensive game but I've never had so much fun. It is packed with hundreds of hours of pure laughter and randomness. You never know what you will find in this game. Keep this in mind though, this is a MOD and it is mostly just community made content so it may have it's bugs. But what game doesn't? Only thing I can complain about is the ability of making a joinable server. I never could make one. Oh well, I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone. A true **10/10** game. P.S. you should probably buy CS:S (Counter Strike: Source) while you're at it. Many of the servers require it. Have fun!

Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

And no, I'm not 11 years old... :p Add 40 years to that. Yes, 51. My life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world. The Elder Scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun I have found and Skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far! Do download the DLC (Downloadable contents) right away as the latest DLC (Dragonborn) includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive TWO perk points when reading ability books! BUT! Yes, there's a but. The game is so vast that there are some bugs... You need to play this with the Elder Scrolls Wiki (http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Quests_(Skyrim)) opened in a browser (ideally in a separate monitor) when playing to see the various issues with each quests or dungeons (like how not to completely mess up the ""Blood on the Ice"" quest so you can get to finally buy the somptuous Hjerim house in Windhelm). BUT number 2. Yes, there is another issue. You may SERIOUSLY consider adding a few ""mods"" to your game since they may fix some of the ""bugs"" mentioned. For exemple : adding the Dawnguard DLC will make Vampires appear and KILL potentially VITAL characters depending on the sort of build your are trying to achieve for your character! Geeez. You would think they would have thought of a way to hold these attacks until you start the quest? NO they didn't! But.... There's a ""mod"" that actually does this for you : preventing ALL vampire attacks (which may KILL city vendors and other characters) until you actually start the quest! Yep, this means, sorry lad, but you REALLY should take a stroll around the modding area, easily accessible in Steam by clicking the Workshop button under your PLAY button in the Games Library (once you've selected Skyrim). There are a few really cool mods I like apart from this one. One is called Run for your lives! And also makes all villagers run inside when there's a DRAGON attack. Again, preventing important characters from simply being wiped out before you get a chance to kill them yourself! :p Apart from that, the game is just insanely good...

When this game was first released, it was still unfinished. There were many bugs and issues, some of which made playing the game difficult to say the least; However, it was still one of the best games of 2011. Over the years, these issues have largely been addressed and the game is now more stable. The visuals in Skyrim were stunning, absolutely stunning, when compared with it's predecessor, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, released Six-years earlier. Using the then new Creation Engine, Skyrim is a hyper-realistic world for the player to explore much like Morrowwind, with a size similar to Cryodill in Oblivion. Skyrim has several DLC packs, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn all of which are a part of the Legendary Edition. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is a game every RPG gamer should have in their library. Most of the bugs and issues, present when the game was first released have been resolved. There is also a library of Mod's available for Skyrim if you know where to look to personalize the game the way you want it. If you enjoyed Oblivion, you should also enjoy Skyrim, as it has a more realistic world design from Oblivion, though is similar in actual overall size. ~Potential Spoilers~ Skyrim, takes place 200 years after the events of Oblivion, in the Northern Lands of Skyrim on Tamriel. You play as the Dragonborne, someone who has the ability to absorb the souls of a Dragon and call upon the magical ability, Thu'um, known as the Shout of the Dragon.

I used to have a postive review on this game and was planning to get back into this game. But Bethesda and Valve decided to do something that not even EA would do and that is force paying for user created Mods. Yes I understand that no work should be done for free and yes I do agree hat modders should get rewarded for their work and dedication. BUT i don't agree that I should be forced to pay for Mods, that is why donations exist. Since the dawn of PC gaming Mods has always been free and this should never change. The reason Mods exist is because gamers want to show their passion for a game they love and extend the life of the game and share their dedication to other people. As a result people would donate to show their appreciation to the modders dedication. But now that time is gone apparently because now apparently people are as greedy as ever. What happens to the people like myself who already donated money to modders but now have this pay wall to force pay a particular mod? This is shady business practice and if this doesn't change soon then pirating will become a bigger issue and everyone will lose. Till then I don't recomend the steam version and the pirated version seems the better choice to show that this new business practice is huge mistake.","Apr 23, 2015, 5:14PM",0,"Apr 23, 2015, 5:13PM",0.6666666666666661,78,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.114285714285714, 'num_achievements_possible': 35, 'num_achievements_attained': 4}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065704821,52,76561198065704821,28.0,26,242.4,Jacy Kururugi,1,Not Recommended,19.0,397,0,65,176,0.7978237182416866,0.87694067

This is the first year that it has disappointed me so much that I actually tried to lobby to get my money back from Steam rather than trust the patch system to right the ship. Steam obviously flat out refused to help me which I guess its written in the rules, and steam lacks any sort of heart for its customers so that was a wasted effort. My main irritation is the injuries. It seems some of you experience the injury issue and some don't. Working with Sounders FC within two friendlies and a league game I lost Obafemi Martins, Brad Evans, and Pineda to injuries during the match. 4 days later in what I put in as light training I lost Chad Barrett for 4 months, and Ozzie Alonso for 3 months. Those injuries crippled my team for a grand total of 5 months, all within the span of a week. In my entire life of ever watching soccer/football I have never ever seen this happen. This is supposed to be the most realistic league simulator in all of gaming right? Well not anymore. The other glaring issue is whicher agorathim they use for what I call the ""fair shake factor"". In my first friendly I had the Seattle Sounders with mostly starting level players going up against a regional team (Semi pro at best) and I got smashed 4 to 1. Sounders FC almost never get beat, especially to teams from what I would consider a beer league team. This is terrible. They broke Football Manager 2015 as far as I can tell.

You become enslaved and before long all you'll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won't even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don't. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust. If you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you're terrible at the game and don't consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get ""good"", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won't come back, ever. And within a month you'll find yourself just parrotting the same  people were yelling at you for earlier, because you'll be one of them by that point. And you literally will not return. You'll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language.","Apr 6, 2014, 11:51AM",0,"Apr 6, 2014, 11:27AM",0.7421875,128,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.268292682926829, 'num_achievements_possible': 41, 'num_achievements_attained': 11}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetriplehonks,95,thetriplehonks,32.0,33,22.2,"cC Chen, Honkifex Maximus",0,Not Recommended,144.0,1607,23,22,157,0.7391187950780085,0.79841006

This game is an all around mess and an all around success in all aspects. Many call it a finished product and a BLAST to play and some call it an unplayable mess which involves complete ""hyper realistic fails"". So who is right? Well, this game appeals to both an arcade style audience willing to get action and combat at extreme levels and also to the hardened clan fighting veteran focused on mods which improve gameplay and add features to the game to improve and keep game experiences fresh. In this game however, having played it for solid hours on end, these moments which I had did not come naturally. For a game to acheive its scale and realism to levels as in ARMA 3 is by no means accepted to all in this generation. Not trying to put my old man cap on here but to play games like DayZ and ARMA you can't expect double kills and planes and cars to appear at the spawn. The PMC's of advanced warfare didn't appear in the army for just being strong and chosen. To play ARMA, it is the same as DayZ (although not as boring) and all ""running simulators"". And I don't mean to scare you by saying to have to run to Pygros from Kavala with broken legs. What I mean is the same principle that you DON'T start as a badass, and if that is your playstyle just don't play it or convince yourself that you can take the heat. Stories have to be made with extreme disiplinary acts in this game. And how do you get those? Well here are the steps. 1. THIS GAME TAKES SOME ING BALLS TO GET WHERE YOU NEED TO GO. This can always be avoided (LOL not really) some way or another through the vast expanse of gamemodes like wasteland, and joining a realsim unit is all acceptable for even the hardest MLG sniper to learn what this game is about. But this part cannot be let go. In parts where the game is about serious progression, you CAN'T be the one crying for someone to give you a chance because you are being a little  cat. To be the general, you gotta go through West Point first. 2. THIS GAME WILL BRING YOU DOWN TO YOUR ING KNEES AND WILL ALWAYS  WITH YOU. So, how do not let this happen? Well you really ING can't. It all happens in a matter where if you are in the right place at the right time which perfectly demonstrates how this game IS SUPPOSED TO BE. This is why you need to be with a team of people who know what they are doing and know exactly WHAT THE HELL is going on, or be daring and be alone, being a target, and dying. Just like in an animal world. So treat it like that. Hunt or be hunted, kill or be killed, the strong only survive. Because this is no FPS that you have ever seen and before buying this, you have to know what is coming for your soul. Oh, but I have decided to roast your  again by saying that this game is amazing fun. ""Oh, but you said it took a long time and was boring."" 3. SHUT THE HELL UP AND LISTEN TO ME. Because if you don't you will die. This game, has changed my perspective on what it is. Well, what is this game? What does it offer? What are you in for? To be honest, this game is really a test of mentality. This game is really to see what you do in dire situations of disaster, catastrophe, military occupation, and survival. This can tie in to thinking of this game as an animal world like I said before. To live, you have to be familiar with your surroundings, familiar with the weapons, and all around just knowing WHAT THE  YOU ARE DOING. Because this game is never merciful and is always working against you as said in my other steps above. So how can you alter this? You can't. You can't change the future. You can't CHANGE your actions in this game. Because it defeats the whole purpose.",,0,"Feb 22, 2015, 2:35PM",0.7272727272727271,11,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.09523809523809501, 'num_achievements_attained': 2, 'num_achievements_possible': 21}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055317425,8,76561198055317425,13.0,3,475.3,Efrafa,1,Recommended,156.0,357,2,16,124,0.7405255131275349,0.8079791

New players are turned away because of this and older players have a worse time leading to further negativity towards other players. The graphics aren't the worst, but they aren't that good. For a game that thrives on detailed team-play and champion strategies it stunts the potential. The only reason this game could be considered as more difficult than other games in this genre would be the graphics and lingering hero game-play. The graphics make it difficult to see what exactly is going on and doesn't get much easier as you progress. Pretty much every hero has at least one ability that will root/stun/slow ect. for around 4 seconds. When a game has that kind of kill security it doesn't matter if the champions are Balanced. I've played many other Game in this genre and they were all much more enjoyable than DOTA 2. When I first played a game or two It was extremely easy compared to league of legends or other similar games. It may be more difficult to see what's going on but the spells are so overpowered on all the heroes that it was easy coming from game that have underpowered spells. The worst thing About DOTA 2 would be the Item system that has been Implemented. It's just ridiculous how it's not user friendly at all.

My empire had grown large, powerful. I had it all in the palm of my hand. The Pyramids had rose before me. The secrets of the nuclear age were but a click before my command. My people were happy, lively. I had created not a kingdom, but an existence. But alas, all things must come to an end. The wife got sick of me not paying attention to her; The kids had already grown up and started going to school. I checked my hours on steam. '4102 hours on record? no..that can't be right!', i announced loudly. I arose from the chair, my sweat had partially ruined the leather seating at this point, and the smell made her gag. I begged, pleaded. 'Please, i love you! We all make mistakes! Take me back!..right after i finish this last turn!'. One turn. My army was in place for the final strike. All enemies, friends, allies would fall with this one swoop. All i needed was one final turn. It was my legacy, my life, my dedication..Or my family. In the end, looking back, i believe i made the right choice.

I'll keep it brief. Dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you. But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy. So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance!

First, they try to force people onto their own DRM platform by restricting retail copies from being activated on Steam; all to save the standard 30% cut to Valve. But that's nothing compared to intentionally misleading customers by jacking the price and applying a 25% 'discount', which brings the price a massive 1 lower than the previous asking price.

While I would recommend this game to friends, because the game itself is a blast, you must be warned that the company behind it has fallen from grace since this game's launch. Yes, I play this game often, but I've learned to deal with the stress and anger the game can bring me. Why do I say that? Let's Break it Down. Company History - 4/10 Simple, Rockstar was a dedicated game developer from the early 2000's until right about 2013, the intial GTA V era. 2015 swings around and the PC version is finally ready, they release it to a pre-ordering public knowing the game wasnt launch-ready and recieve a wave of broken reports. Two weeks later they remove the ability to get several guns and vehicles all because current PC players dont have or have played the console version. Which means you have to spend $120 to get a few items. Then comes the infamous Summer Sale Scam of 2015. Rockstar charging flat $60 for their game, whether you buy the base, a shark card that would undo the refundability of your game, or the game bound with another game. Just massive profit whoring, just like with the Shark Card. The Ill Gotten Gains Update added a plane costing $10,000,000GTA, and the Megaladon Shark Card of $8,000,000GTA is $100USD. Which means the Luxor Deluxe, to Rockstar, is worth $125USD. Absolutely absurd. Singplayer Playability - 7/10 GTA V as a game is great. It's aesthetically pleasing and flowing, controls far better than IV ever did, and just feels more alive than any previous installment. While lacking the proper absurdity of game like San Andreas and Vice City, it was its own breed of good, and as a Singleplayer game, it was very pleasing. As for the replayability? The game becomes dreadfully boring after you beat the main story. The game gives no incentive to complete the remaining 40% of the game once the main story is over, and you dont get hardly enough money from the final job to enjoy anything in the game. The only reason Singleplayer gets a 7 out of 10 is purely because the main story is fantastic and well done. Online Playability - 0/10 I wish my scale went negative. Everything Rockstar promised in Online simply isn't there. ""No hacking allowed"" they said. I'm yet to find a lobby without one. ""Instantly joins lobbies with your friends"" they said. Nope, every game I join always says my friends are in other games. ""Better anti-cheat software"" they say, nope, if anything there has been a spike in hackers. ""More content: they say. Ill Gotten Gains was a money sink, not a content additon. The game is pathetically boring after completing the 5 heists, that have no replayability to them, and farming countless missions, races, and deathmatches until you get sick of even seeing your own apartment. Amongst the personal issues with Online, there is also the issue that there is so much possiblity and hardly anything done to match it. No realistic immersion to the game. No bars, no car shows, no dance clubs, no cafes, no way to relax with friends, and only one club... a strip club. The game is hopefully going to be adding mansions in Ill Gotten Gains part 2, which would grant more freedoms to players, such as owning a pool and a tennis court, but there needs to be more immersion. The game only has 1 golf course, when there could easily be 2 more... 1 in the desert, and 1 in the mountains or Paleto Bay area. The game also lacks any way of bringing the community together to do events, the only events that happen in free roam are chaos inducing ones, which a lot of players avoid. There needs to be raves on the beach, or maybe even events like car shows or drag races that players can attend and spectate or participate in in free mode. There's just sooo much the game can be, that it just isn't. The most recent update also brought my average frames from 70 stable on Very High to about 15 and choppy until it crashes on the lowest settings. Rockstar flat out broke their game, and even high tier machines struggle with it now. They decided to combat mods and hacks by adding several hundred lines of false code to the game, which as a result broke the game, and left mods and hacks completely unharmed. The game is broken and unplayable, and until it's fixed, very few people will be able to play online. Game Overall - 3/10 The lack of support from Rockstar's end, combined with the malestrom that is GTA Online, and the quickly overbearingly boring Singleplayer Mode, I have to say this game went from the best thing to ever happen to PC gaming to a sad excuse of how a good game developer can go bad very quickly. Will i continue to play this game? Yes. I enjoy it, but there is a lot to improve on. Will i recommend it to friends? Yes, I enjoy playing with friends and the game is a great way to hang out with them. But, will i recommend it to you? No. Unless you know more than 5 people who own it and play it regularly, it's just simply not worth your money. Your time is of your choice, but dont give Rockstar your money. RECAP Developer Score - 4/10 Base Game Score - 7/10 Online Game Score - 0/10 Ninja's Game Score - 5/10 Final Score - 4/10, Would not recommend unless you really just need something to waste time on with friends and be constantly disappointed in both the developing company and the community behind it when updates come out and break the game. The Pure amount of hackers will drive you away quickly, and if they dont, Rockstar's endless attempts to get more money from you without any effort from them surely will. Play at your own risk.","Jul 13, 2015, 7:27PM",4,"Jun 25, 2015, 10:34PM",0.7000000000000001,30,"{'num_achievements_possible': 60, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.616666666666666, 'num_achievements_attained': 37}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamninja28,21,iamninja28,20.0,9,610.1,Ninja,0,Not Recommended,289.0,277,1,3,144,0.6651565164674236,0.65299636

It used to be paid, but it went free to play in 2011. The graphics, despite being a bit old already, still look good and stylish. The maps are usually well-designed and interesting to look at. The gameplay stands out from your other FPS games for being very different than conventional shooters out there. You can pick from nine different classes: offensive (Scout, Soldier, Pyro), defensive (Demo, Heavy, Engineer) and support (Medic, Sniper, Spy), each with their own unique tools, style, strengths and weaknesses. This forces you to work with your teammates to cover each other's weakpoints and emerge victorious. There are two main gamemodes: PvP and MvM. The former has a lot of sub-modes, such as Payload, Control Points, Attack / Defense, King of the Hill, or Capture The Flag. The latter, on the other hand, pits a team of six players in a co-op tower defense mode against hordes of bloodthirsty robots, with the objective of preventing them from delivering a bomb to the end of the map. There is a lot of unlockable weapons, which allow you to customize and change your gameplay style, as well as a ton (and I mean a ton ) of cosmetic items, which serve no purpose besides looking cool. The music, while it can't be heard outside of main menu or promotional videos, is very good and fun to listen to even outside the game. Unfortunately, this game also has cons. Due to the amount of hats content, the game is very heavy, so computers that aren't brand-new might experience some performance issues. Also, due to it being free to play, pub servers are often filled with noobs who have no idea what they're doing, which can destroy your gaming experience considering the game is teamwork-reliant. Multiple Snipers and Spies is a common occurence. The community is also... well, not the worst, but one of the worst. Just a quick glance at the forums reveals a ton of unusual and Australium-toting ""git gud"" elitists who aren't very pleasant to talk to if you're new... or in general. However, that doesn't mean there aren't any people who are actually helpful towards newcomers. Overall, I highly recommend this game to everyone. FPS veterans however should be prepared for a drastically different experience.","Apr 29, 2015, 8:01AM",0,"Apr 17, 2015, 2:51PM",0.952380952380952,42,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.756756756756756, 'num_achievements_attained': 392}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek,40,vallinek,13.0,2,1047.3,Vallinek,16,Recommended,128.0,5911,6,20,32,0.75736374040741,0.77255607

The game itself is great, I love the new features, graphics, characters, etc. However, there are so many bugs and problems it makes playing impossible. The first most annoying problem is the crashing. At startup, the game crashes after looping the intro sound for about 5 minutes. Only after that can you play by pressing the retry button. Second, the game is very, very, very laggy. After playing about 10 minutes of smooth as silk gameplay, the game fluctuates from high fps to 0, in many stutters. It is not my pc or anything because the game is very smooth with inconsistent, frequent stutters, not a rough constant fps. This makes playing unbearable, even low fps would be preferred. Lastly, a few minor bugs are that in the voice settings menu, if you go down to it, the game automatically freezes and crashes. UPDATE: For some reason, I played today and got dream results. No crashing for the first time ever when opening, and it did not stutter once, even after leaving the game for some time. Amazing getting to play the game the way it was meant to be played, I only hope it stays this way.","May 29, 2015, 5:28PM",0,"May 28, 2015, 12:26PM",0.8888888888888881,27,"{'num_achievements_possible': 60, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.133333333333333, 'num_achievements_attained': 8}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198111835390,24,76561198111835390,3.0,3,162.5,Ghetto Potato,0,Not Recommended,9.0,0,0,1,41,0.6321894036305962,0.5498187

I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need. Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home. Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try. While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions. The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the ""follower"" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings. It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan. While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to ""find cover"" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body. Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons. Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface. Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on ""Patrol"" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process. After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take. Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.",,0,"Apr 18, 2015, 1:34AM",0.916666666666666,24,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeyStreak,22,KeyStreak,,2,319.2,--||  ||--,0,Recommended,,0,0,0,0,0.7796073878913538,0.7628916

What an f'ing disgrace. Actual Review - Many game companies fall into the habit of getting caught up in the new features each iteration of their game come out with, while neglecting the problems inherent in the core game itself. We get it, its hard to sell a game to new customers if the biggest thing you can advertise is ""We toyed with the balancing all year!"" or ""We sorted out all the issues with the code!"". FM unfortunatly has fallen into just that trap. Anyone who has played the past several years of FM can tell you that while many new features have been added, they have by and large slapped onto a  foundation of code that struggled under the weight of a match engine it could not adequately support. Watching your 30 million pound striker send a suicide man's backpass to the keeper from an attacking postion, wingers shooting at impossible angles on goals, keepers booting the ball off their own players and into the goal... and so on. Any person with a shred of computer programming literacy could tell you that what SI needed to do was go back to square one. Instead, SI made the mind numbingly awful decission to slap a brand new, considerably more complicated match engine, on top of their  code, and had the gall to advertise it as a completely new product. Low and behold, you have one of the worst footy simulators to have graced this earth. It colapses under it own weight with comical regularity (Just watch your players freeze on the pitch for no reason, like someone turned the power off.). No patch is gonna be able to polish this turd.

The developer, Digital Extremes, is the studio behind The Darkness 2 and Dark Sector. Digital Extremes gets involved with the community, by providing regular patches, video updates and participation in the forums. Digital Extremes borrows heavily from their previous game Dark Sector that was developed in 2008 and scrapped on 2012 in favor of making Warframe. Summary +Great Atmosphere/Environments +Great Weapon/Skills/Character Selection +Great Clan System (Dojo is impressive) +Great Developer Support(updates are good chunks and come often) +Great movement opportunities(Running across wall is fun) -Grind(Blueprints/Materials) Gameplay The gameplay is pretty solid, if you are looking something flashy like Devil May Cry, you are not going to get it here. That being said, the variation of weapons really make up for this. The warframes themselves are great in terms of variety and design. Each one has stats and abilities that set them apart, which results in a fresh experience every time you play with a new warframe. Being able to run along walls or run up them makes mobility in the game more dynamic in terms of getting from point A to point B. Rank System Rank system emphasis on developing experience with Warframes, weapons and equipment rather than getting exp in general. Your rank is a signature of how much firepower you have accumulated in your arsenal. Since rank challenges vary it will test a wide array of your skills from marksmanship, mobility, and combat abilities. This system results in the player being more well rounded by fleshing out your skills in a multitude of areas. Customization Upgrading, transmuting, and fusion are several methods to improve your options. The level of equipment acts as points for attaching mods. This allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages, to fight certain factions or missions. The forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further. Atmosphere The setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game. The atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments. The new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks. Updates As someone who made a long guide for this game I can say that their updates are so solid I feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant. This is most apparent in their UI changes they have made which made my videos a-bit weird to see for the newer players. Clan The dojo is one of the nicest additions I have seen yet. Not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it. The dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp, and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research. Pay to Win? If you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured thats not how it is. The only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots. You can put time in and get the same results you just can't have many Warframes/Weapons at once. They also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas. For example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process. So instead of buying the weapon, you can collect the resources, craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you don't have to wait. Grinding? Yes, there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials. Generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the pay-off aka the warframe as soon as possible. The grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints. This is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability. So if you do not mind grinding, buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough. Conclusion Overall Warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a Pay to Win game. If you are looking for an interesting game.... just give it a try, I am sure it won't disappoint.","Oct 21, 2014, 10:19AM",3,"Nov 26, 2013, 7:34AM",0.76453488372093,688,"{'num_achievements_attained': 10, 'num_achievements_possible': 10, 'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos,526,astralchaos,42.0,162,699.0,Falem,5,Recommended,497.0,607,7,55,921,0.7776544303909593,0.82435584

The recoil of the weapons is dramatic and infuriatingly unreal looking. It's very possible to almost completely miss a target standing in front of you at no more than 1 meter (gamewise meter) and deliver only one hit with the AK. The AWP for example isn't the surgical instrument of death no more. The shoot area isn't a dot (the dot in the center of your reticle) but a quite large ""box"". Also the physics of it seem a bit off, I cannot understand how you can be stopped from running from being hit with a smoke grenade, HE grenade, flash bang or molotov/incendiary. It is ridiculous and reminds me of the old stuck-in-the-ground with smoke launched at feet bug in Counter-Strike 1.4. I have the frustrating sensation that I am constantly playing a BETA game, a BETA I have purchased. Also lots of cheaters in Competitive matches. Competitive matches were supposed to be the bread and butter of the new series but the experience is very often destroyed by obvious cheat using players. I guess it is so easy to cheat in this game since there are lots of them. The Overwatch isn't helping much and participating in the Overwatch program ruins the faith in this program because 4 in 5 demos submited to Overwatch have players blatantly using wallhack. I guess the Overwatch can VAC ban one and while 10 more players start using it. In spite of all it has potential, it looks good and the maps, the old ones and the new ones added, are interesting and fun to play.","Nov 26, 2013, 11:44AM",0,"Nov 26, 2013, 10:36AM",0.9090909090909092,11,"{'num_achievements_possible': 51, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.568627450980392, 'num_achievements_attained': 29}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutalistu,10,brutalistu,80.0,1,2215.5,brutalistu,0,Recommended,359.0,87,1,5,1734,0.7000296967730404,0.65776527

I paid $60 for the base game with no DLC and ""Legendary"" edition is only $40 I think with no option to upgrade from base. Even during a weekend deal on Skyrim the ""Legendary"" edition is only $14 while the DLC is $17!? How is the DLC more expensive than the base game + DLC!? Why do they hate their pre-order fans so much and only give good deals to new people? 2. Paid mods. This is not an effort to support modders and give an option for people to make money doing what they love. From what I've read modders only get a 25% cut, that means Valve is taking in 75% FREE MONEY for work they didn't do.

The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp. The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team. This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages. Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive. The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2. While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk. Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol. Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice! Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for over $400 USD. CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 300,000 players. There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth.

I don't recomend this game anymore for anyone, if you have a PC nowadays you're fuc*ed, basicly the best of PC is doing what you want and having this ""freedom"" to mod your games, change settings, etc... If you don't want to see my entire review of the game, I think these few lines are wort, but from now on, I'll just say everything wrong I see with paid mods, in EVERY game. So basicly I'll say Skyrim is a broken game(wuuuut you say), yes, I have a good PC, and I can play games like GTA V with high settings, LoL and DotA on ultra with more than 100 fps, and other games(I just said that 3 so you know how my PC handles some good/great graphics games and intense in other ways). and Skyrim basicly forces you to play under 64 fps, and everyone who have a monitor with more than 60hz(most commom are 75hz and 120hz) knows that you'll have some problems with the game without any MODfication; other than that aspect, Skyrim have visible lags when it shouldn't have, like, you're in a inn, and have a lag(wuut?), or you're walking and have some serious stuttering issues! The game is made for a slow PC, or, a CONSOLE! So, basicly, you're paying money for a game that was made for a console, but you have a PC, and you know Skyrim is great(not that much, without mods...) because your friends said so, or you saw some gameplays and stuff, and you want to unbreak this broken game. Now you have this amazing thing called ""mod"", and you have a freaking awesome community that makes mods for everything, really, there is a mod(a great one by the way) that makes your sneak atack sound change to ""SURPRISE MUTHAFUC*A!"", and other mods that change skins, game textures, add sounds, relight the ENTIRE FUC*ING GAME, and more! So, why I think mods shouldn't be paid? Now is the real deal, when a guy spend 100h+ making a mod, or 1h, or even 1minute, he knew that it wasn't for money, he made the mod because he's a great person, and want to change the game for better! He knew that most people don't even know his name and never will, because a commom person just want the mod, and that's it. Now with mods getting money what I think(and I'm sure this will happen, and I'll try to explain why) will happen from now on. People will do theirs mods, upload to Workshop and wait for the money in their pockets, but that will not happen, because you'll get a freaking huge enterprise making mods, and they'll sell it, and man, this looks weird but yeah, that's called DLC...it's the fuc*ing DLC problem, we had DLCs since The Sims, maybe even before, but now games launchs with a DLC already, I remember people bashing Mass Effect 3 because of the before launch-DLC, and man, now every freaking game a DLC before launch; and it sounds I'm crazy but that's how it works, if you don't do anything about it, people will get what they want, and I know for sure that most people that do mods don't need or don't expect that money, because that's how it worked...now you'll have the iest mods, with the highest prices and that'll be fine, because you let them do it! So just for the information purpose, why I think huge enterprises will do the mod/DLC stuff? Because what they sell to you is a unfinished game, it's just a demo, a beta, a alpha for some games(coff coff CoD coff), and they make these DLCs before launch, ask you for your money and you pay because you like the game, isn't your fault, it's industry fault! Now they'll have another type of DLC, the mod DLC, that will change your entire game, you don't know if it'll work in your PC, if it's good, if it worth it even!

Because of this recent event it has occurred to me that reviews of games should be about what the game itself offers and not what the community can/could offer. So having said that, I cannot recommend Skyrim at full price because the game is full of bugs, issues, and reeks of being a blatant console port. There are glaring issues that still haven't been fixed for the past three and a half years the game has currently been available on both consoles and PC's, but of course the modding community has fixed these problems on PC. However, the game at its core is great and is totally worth it at a discounted price, but keep in mind that the game isn't as fleshed out as recent installments in the past. Some people refer to this issue as ""Consolitis"", so if you're a fan of Morrowind and/or Oblivion you'll probably be disappointed with the vanilla Skyrim experience, but will be more than surprised with mod variety. If you're a new player to the RPG genre and have never played a Elder Scrolls game before you'll definitely fall in love with this one, but be warned that trying to go back and playing the older Elder Scroll games might leave you with a bad taste in your mouth because of how dated those games are, so I'd recommend going back and trying to play Morrowind or Oblivion first so you can enjoy those great games and then come back and enjoy Skyrim. Outdated Review from April 25th, 2015; Skyrim is an amazing game and is definitely worth the full amount and is a must buy at a discounted price, however due to recent events of Valve/Bethesda having the bright idea of allowing community made mods to be sold on the Steam Workshop has changed my view of the game entirely. As of right now, I cannot recommend this game while the current Workshop system is in place. I also do not recommend buying other Bethesda games until this change has been reversed and mind you this is coming from a huge Bethesda fan that has been playing Bethesda games since Morrowind on the original Xbox. I'd also like to note that this is not a ""knee-jerk"" reaction as some people like to claim. Since this system has been put in place some modders have shown their true colors of greed by refusing to update their ""free"" mods and other people stealing free mods from 3rd party sites and selling them on the Workshop while Valve/Bethesda turn a blind eye. Money has corrupted the modding community and Valve/Bethesda are to blame. Do not support this system as it only hurts the modding community and will more than likely hurt future games like TES:VI and Fallout 4.","May 2, 2015, 4:17AM",0,"Apr 25, 2015, 3:12PM",0.75,12,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.8083832335329341, 'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_attained': 135}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/EChondo,9,EChondo,22.0,3,244.3,EChondo,0,Not Recommended,52.0,278,1,18,466,0.7126953787701389,0.80651784

Just too many issues (and it appears I'm not the only one), to mention in one review so I will list my biggest bugbears; - Injuries - like many others, each save game has been dominated with injuries (FM (Liverpool), FMC (Liverpool), FM (custom)). Of course many players get injured but I have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 2/3 reserve and youth players. This means on average i have about 8 senior players injured (6-8 weeks is the most common length) - Training - there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things. It is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one (for example - attacking training). There is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes. Why would i want the likes of Skrtel, Toure and Sakho doing Attacking training the majority of the time? It is just lazy game designing. On top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload - no matter what you try to fix it. - Talking to players - again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side. You only have the same options available. Sure you can try to ""convince"" players but only with intangible promises. - e.g promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player - Everything is short term - ""this is my plan for this season"" - Most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan. You should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety - e.g have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop, or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc - teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees - it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out. -tactics are inflexible - rarely does it work if you want to play a fast, short game. Or a slow, direct game. This is nothing like real life, remember Liverpool last season? Or Stoke every season? plus they still haven't brought back player runs - a huge miss for tactical control. The biggest problem? Matchday - I watch it on 2D to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist. The two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of all......Opponent takes a shot, kepper makes a save, ball comes back into the penalty box, keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the net......funny thing is it only happens to your keeper. Plus the tactics you use don't have a big effect on the game. I tested this out by doing the old save/restart cheat against West Brom at home. (Tried 442,451,433 with different player combinations and tactics......each time lost 2-1 or 2-0 On the plus side it looks prettier. Unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for Miles and the SI team to make real improvements. Each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return. At least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before it's official release date. If you would like to play alternative manager games i recommend FM11 and Premier manager 97, those games felt like the developers cared",,0,"Dec 24, 2014, 11:33AM",0.804195804195804,286,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050674374,230,76561198050674374,,56,422.1,dariusx10,0,Not Recommended,,0,4,0,0,0.715681982535369,0.6155494

When I first saw it, I expected it to be a run-of-the-mill sort of PvP Free to Play game that is attempting to mirror the style of Team Fortress 2, a titan of F2P. But, I gave it a chance and boy was I wrong. This Co-operative space ninja game with out-of-this-world graphics blew me away and I asked my friend that surely they would charge money for this but he said, ""Free forever, forever fun."" The customization of this is astounding from various weapons, colors, materials, and even warframes (which are utilitzed as weapons too). The game designers also implemented loot rooms in the more difficult ""Void"" tilesets that require you to use your Warframe's ability to basically do parkour to go places where you typically wouldn't think. Personally, it feels like if Mirror's Edge and Team Fortress 2 birthed a demigod of a child that had some awesome genetic mutations. I currently have logged over a hundred hours and with the release of Update 11, I'm predicting many more.

Ambient lighting and effects are excellent and the designers have succeeded in creating a diverse and atmospheric landscape. Character creation is good with a lot of customisation possible. All this, however, is completely and utterly eclipsed by what is possible with Mods. With Mods (readily available from the steam workshop) gamers are able to create breathtakingly stunning vistas, highly realistic characters, followers and NPC's. With over 24 thousand mods (at the time of this review) you can change the appearance of or add in pretty much anything you can imagine (the sky really is the limit). There is of course a performance trade-off when applying the ultra high definition textures and graphical mods so I recommend following one of the excellent guides available to find the right balance for you. Audio 9 Music is grand and epic, very fitting to the feel of the game. Sound effects and voice acting are both excellent throughout and considering how many characters and quests there are in the world of skyrim this is quite a feat. Personal favourites for voice acting include the aptly named khajiit: M'Aiq the liar and the deranged murderous jester: Cicero. Gameplay 9 Skyrim is a joy to play, its not perfect but its pretty close. Controls are intuitive, responsive and work well with either mouse/keyboard or controller. There are many choices to be made throughout the game with real consequences, factions will favour you or attack you depending on your actions and alignment with other factions. There are many different playstyles and strategies to Skyrim, finding what works best for you is all part of the fun. Skills and abilities progress as you use them so you aren't completely restricted to a class such as mage or ranger, want to use a little bit of magic but also kill with a bow - no problem. Skyrim is often compared to its predecessors (Oblivion and Morrowind) to highlight some of flaws in the game, and while its true to say some of the missions and areas feel overused (oh? another cave filled with draugr you say?) and there are other occasional glitches, considering the massive scope and scale of the game these seem fairly minor. Skryim in certain ways surpasses its predecessors and is at very least well deserving of its place in this legendary series. Story 10 So much detail, so much depth, the lore and background to the Elder Scrolls series is second to none. In Skyrim there are huge libraries packed with books containing everything from children's stories to hidden tomes of magic to the history of the lands. Talking to the people you meet tells of their individual struggles and also adds to the overarching story of a land rife with conflict and caught in far reaching changes of which you find your character the center. Skyrim is rich with background and story, as you explore and interact with the characters around you its very easy to feel part of the world. Quests are (with a few minor exceptions) interesting, challenging and varied with each of them building your understanding of the world and your place in it. Replayability 10 You only need to look at the number of hours people put into this game to realise how much Skyrim has to offer. Personally I had already completed this game many times before I got it on steam and was still able to get many more hours of enjoyment than the average rpg, I'm sure it wont be the last time I play Skyrim either. Modding here also helps immensely with the community creating a huge collection of different locations, characters and quests. Overall 9.5 An outstanding game, if you haven't tried it then your missing out on a truly amazing gaming experience.

Over time, however, things will get better, and you'll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time it's not your fault; it's your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it's your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn't give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because ""he couldn't farm in lane."" You know, however, that he is just a noob. Eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it's better if you just quit now. While you're waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat ""team noob"" followed up by ""report anti-mage."" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as ""lol ur so bad"" and ""ur just mad cuz you cant play."" You could also take the alternative route and say things like ""  "" and ""   .""

Gun sway is obnoxious, optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight, the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musket-levels of pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification, you simply hear him moan incessently. The game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate DLC's which you need to buy to pilot or use. Despite the hefty price of Arma 3, you can expect the ratio price of the DLC's to be roughly 20 percent of Arma 3's original cost. The helicopter DLC, for instance, contains only two helicopters and a ""realism"" mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure. They, the creators of a military simulator, also randomly brought in a DLC that lets you race around in a go-kart. No, I don't know why either. You can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and front-grips - no one really knows why they discriminated. Not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod, edge of a window or bonnet of a car. The body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured., what weighs more, what weighs less. Many of the ""futuristic"" weapons on Arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life (AH-99 Blackfoot) or don't actually exist (such as T-100 Varsuk) making the game incredibly peculiar. It's also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require third-party software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software. The experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the game's scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point. Queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semi-conscious d1ckh3ads who can't get to the fuc king point. Buildings are only superficially destructible, they won't crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruins.Tanks can also be defeated by a farmer's three foot stonewall. Yes. And collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes. Overrall I would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space. Arma 2 including its DLC'S have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons. And whilst Arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alpha-staging in Earth's entire gaming history, Bohemia's employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance ""coincidently"" where they were basing Altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there. What the fu ck were they thinking? Ridiculous, ludicrous. Don't buy this game.

Positives: Skins (You can earn or lose money on skins, u can buy skins, trade skins, open cases and EARN money from that, almost same like TF 2, but much way better!) Ranks - In game are few choices of types in game, From Arms race to competetive matches, when u must communicate, be skiller etc. When are u playing competetive, and u are winning, u will earn new ranks, u can drop cause losing, or rank up if u are winning. U can start on Silver I and after 100h u can be global elite (Global Elite is the biggest rank) Gameplay - Everything is smooth, good, awes00me. :D This is the main change i think, from CS1.6 and GO... everything is smoother, better headshots, competetive and more... its a really great game, not like CS 1.6... Tournaments - If u are very good, and u got very, VERY good team, you can sign to the tournament, it can be the ""amateur"" tournament (Night cup etc.) or the best,bigger,famous DreamHack, Copenhagen games, EMS etc. U can win skins, money, new graphic card etc. etc. Its really awesome!

In its current state, while playable and fully functional, It pales in comparision with newer tittles. Part of the reason Skyrim sells so well is because of the modding community that constantly creates new content for the game. This content, atracts a wide variety of customers that, while not looking forward to play the game itself, buy the game because of the content they can download and play. Some of these customers do not have a very high income, and choose to only buy the game whenever its on sale, and can only afford moddifications instead of DLC. Restricting DLC not only gives the game itself a bad reputation, but takes away customers. Not only because of the low income some might possess, but also because some even have their own sense of morale that prevents them from buying Unofficial Fan Made DLC. People will download mods less and less as time goes by because of these reasons, and demand will eventually halt to a very slow number. Less people interested in paying, less effort from part of the developers. Why would developers stop making mods eventually? Simple. Developers, eager to make easy money, burn themselves by going agains most of the modding community, which has a sense of morale that prevents them from buying mods. Now that they earn even less recognition from their own community (Recognition in the modding community itself played a big part in the development of mods) , and no one demands mods because of the previously stated reasons, (Combined with the fact that Valve/Bethesda earn 75% of the revenue) will eventually get discouraged from creating new mods, and will move to greener more profitable pastures. (Getting a job at some developer company, or even Indie gaming) While ""gaming backslash"" might not be a big issue for current big profitable developer companies, it does indeed hurts small developers who are just starting to make a living. This has been proven already with several green light games that have failed to appeal to customers in some way or another, and end up ""branding"" the developer. Slowly but surely, this marks the beggining of the end for the modding community, and maybe modding for certain games altogether. DRM policies are soon to be expected, and we can safely predict that the modding ""Market"" will be managed in such a way, that few mods will be able to remain either free, or on sale, thus decreasing demand. (Less variety, less options for the customer, less options, fewer interest from part of the Customer) Again, part of why this game is played, is because of its wide variety of Unofficial Free Fan Made DLC. By restricting this, and allowing Content Creators to charge as they see fit, without any way of quality control, and giving them a very low incentive in the way of 25%, practically screams commercial failure. While not against the idea of letting Developers (Both Official and Unofficial) collect money from Fan Made DLC, it is currently being done in such a way, that pretty much will end ""Skyrim modding as we currently see it"".",,0,"Apr 24, 2015, 2:08AM",0.916666666666666,12,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.746666666666666, 'num_achievements_possible': 75, 'num_achievements_attained': 56}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097977693,11,76561198097977693,3.0,1,763.9,BreakerOfSouls84,0,Not Recommended,2.0,0,0,2,19,0.7714424435908329,0.7389182

It's not a bad game on it's own, but charging AAA price for this yearly database update, and on top of that shamelessly charging 4.5 euros for the ingame editor is the last straw for me. At least give the pre-order buyers a ~40% discount and a free ingame editor, because your yearly rehash is highly overpriced right now, SI/SEGA. Honestly I don't know what I was expecting out of this year's game, it has been exactly the same for what, 5-6 years now? and that's only if you count the annoying interviews and the 3D engine, take those away, and it's the same exact game I played 12 years ago. That would not necessarily be a bad thing if they didn't ask for so much money. The things the game gets wrong, as SI would put it, include (but are not limited to): The economy is screwed up still. The poor, low reputation clubs still ask that you pay more than the player's market value, yet they set your club with their real world budget and debts! They really don't give a damn, it's all about rich clubs and England as usual (because the Premier League is the only important one. Out of 100+ leagues, 100% of people play in the Premier League, right?). The 3D match engine still looks and acts janky as all hell, defenders will just stand next to the loose ball while the opposition striker is charging in at full speed. The amount of goals scored is ""currently"" too high to be remotely realistic. I never had a game without scoring, only 3 without conceding, I beat one team 10-3, played 15 competitive matches, scored 51, and conceded 24 goals, so 75 goals in 15 matches, if I count the 4 friendlies it gets even more ridiculous. The game still has the cheating match engine, you lose to a weaker team, you know it was set up, so you reload the game to test it, you lose again, maybe 10 reloads later you get a draw, but you won't win until you give up the 3D engine and switch to text mode, or til you... that's right folks, until you buy the ingame editor and fix the game. :) - call me a noob and I'll just delete your comment (and assassinate you when you aren't looking), I've been playing the game for 12 years, and I know my tactics and training setups. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't say anything positive about this years changes, would it now? - I like the new interface. As for the recommendation, If you own the last years game, or 2013, 2012... 2004 don't buy this game, the semi updated 3D engine has nothing good to offer, and the rest of the game is totally the same, the database update is not worth the money until the game goes 75% off. If you don't own any FM games, but would like to buy one, get it at 50% off. If you're like me and pre-ordered it, go to the steam store and look at games you could have bought instead, and cry. Or keep playing this, they're bound to patch the stupid out of it at some point, right... right? Finally, here are my scores for the game: Full price score - 5/10 - Absolutely not worth 50 of any world famous currency (except Rubles maybe). 50% off - 7/10 - If you're shaking and FIFA 15 doesn't help, you might want to give FM 15 a shot. 75% off - 8/10 - Get it and enjoy it. By the time it goes down to 75% off, the patches should soften the rough edges, you'll be getting the best version of this years game at a reasonable price.","Dec 24, 2014, 1:25PM",0,"Nov 12, 2014, 11:37AM",0.7653061224489791,98,"{'num_achievements_attained': 0, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.0, 'num_achievements_possible': 15}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dooleh,75,Dooleh,21.0,23,37.8,Dooleh,0,Not Recommended,168.0,1247,0,27,1232,0.6727354939033746,0.6425203

This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of ""Three Lane Highway"" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an ""isometric wizard-em up"" game, and I think it's fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it'll take you a couple hours. And you'll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single ""Multi-player Online Battle Arena"" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota.

Skyrim is a game that brings hours of gameplay for a very small price, the world is beautiful, the quests bring a challenge to every player and so on. In my opinion, Skyrim has to be one of the best RPG games out there, because you can do so much! Once you finish the main game quests, you can still continue to play this game as there are missions that randomly come up when you speak to characters. If you don't like Skyrim how it is, you can modify it, Steam has a Skyrim Workshop and you can change the way your world looks, you can also visit the Nexus Website which is where a lot of people post their mods. In Skyrim, you can have followers that will follow you into the darkest depths of Skyrim, they can help you fight or they can fight for you, they can even live with you in your home. You end up getting a lot of homes, in most of the cities in Skyrim, my favourite is my house in Solitude, which is in my favourite city. I promise you now, that the only way that this game will annoy you is if you download too many mods and your game crashes (thats happened to me a lot). Now that I have finished the main quests in Skyrim, I just roleplay and live in Solitude, I live with Jessica Alba (a mod). I take a lot of screenshots of Skyrim and post them on Steam for everyone to see. Please go and buy this game! Its simply amazing!

Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle. Sound: 9.5/10 All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax.

Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres.

The problem with this however, is that if you have a favourite gamemode that isn't Trboule in Terrorist Town/TTT (Murder mystery), DarkRP (Roleplay) or Sandbox (Sandbox) then the best of luck finding a local server. Also, with the 198,000+ items in the workshop to date, it makes it the second biggest workshop on Steam. If you're looking for a particular thing, such as charcter models/skins, then you have to sift through a lot of rubbish to find what you want. THE GREAT The Gmod community is huge, approaching the likes of L4D2, Portal 2, or even getting to the stage of Team Fortress 2 (At least if it weren't FtP). This means new servers, new addons, new workshop creations, all new each day. It is never the same game twice, unless you choose it to be of course. It is possible to mount games on Gmod, so long as they run on the Source engine. Even so, this means your content from The Half Life games (Source), Portal and L4D series, Team Fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go. And, arguably the best thing about Gmod, is the fact that you can do ANYTHING. Not like most 'realistic' first person shooters which say ""Hop on your bike. You can go anywhere you like! (So long as it's in this general direction.)"" No. If you can think of it, then it can be made. And yes, there are some pretty crazy things out there, but that makes it all the more fun. THE UGLY If you have a favourite gamemode which is fairly unknown and obscure, then there won't be very many people playing it, if you can even connect to the servers. Also, the amount of rubbish in the Steam workshop is appauling. To be clear, they do no give a proper description of their item, they make it unoriginal and generally trolly. This raises another problem, some of the greatest mods for it are lost in all of this. But those are just nitpicks. The WORST thing about this (In my opinion) is the fact that you need assests from other games to play much of this game. You will need Couter Strike: Source for TTT, Half Life 2 + Episodes for DarkRP, and so on. It feels like a newly released game has a glitch in it, and the devs make you pay for the patch. You can feel cheated, and your wallet will feel lighter. THE VERDICT Gmod by itself is about $10 US. The pack that includes CS:S is about $25 US. If you would prefer not to have all the errors, play TTT, use player models from CS:S then I would suggest getting the pack with both of them in it. However, if you are willing to save X amount of money by going and finding addons which will cover that, that will work as well but it will take up more of your time. SIMILAR GAMES -Think of a game. Any game. It's most likely been covered in Garry's Mod. That's how expansive this is.

For TF2, you just have to play a certain amount of time and then later you will acquire some new items! If you're lucky, you could get a misc or even a hat. There are many different qualities for items and weapons in the game. They are Normal, Unique, Strange, Vintage, Genuine, Unusual, Haunted, Collector, Community and Self-Made. There are 9 classes which are the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. These classes are divided into 3 categories. They are Offensive, Defense and Support. Each class specalise in a particular area. The Scout can double jump and is the fastest out of all class which means he can escape from danger with no diffculty. The Soldier can rocket jump to get into higher areas. Pyro can burn enemies and can do compression blast which blasts projectiles away such as rockets and grenades. The Demoman is able to make traps for enemies. Heavy is able to take a lot of damage and has the most health. Engineers are able to construct buildings such as a Sentry Gun to defend points and support the rest of the team. Medics can heal fellow teammates so they are able to survive in battle longer. Sniper can do a significant amount of damage with sniper rifle. Spy can disguise as the enemy team and can sap Engineers' buildings to disable them. As you start Team Fortress 2, there are detailed tutorials that teaches you how to play the particular class efficently. When you finished these tutorials, there is a ""Training"" Mode which enables you to sharpen your skills on bots. Training Mode also has several diffculties. TF2 has many gamemodes. Some examples are Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and Payload. Each gamemode has a certain objective and requires everyone in the team to contribute. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that requires a lot of teamwork. If there is no teamwork, the team is unable to advance to the next point. A unique gamemode called Mann Vs Machine is when 6 players work as a team to prevent waves of invading robots deploying a bomb at a certain point. As you advance through, the waves of robots begin to get increasingly more diffcult. There is also a ""Mann Up"" version. This is the official version of Mann Vs Machine played on offical Valve Mann Up servers. In order to get into these servers, you would need to purchase a ""Tour Of Duty Ticket"". After you complete a mission , you earn a pile of loot which you get at the end when it is ""Victory"" Time. When you complete a Tour Of Duty, you would get normal weapons, Botkiller weapons, Killstreak Kit, an Australium Weapon and many more. TF2 has also many custom mod servers which consist of unoffical gamemodes. Some of these mods are TF2ware and Versus Saxton Hale. The best feature of Team Fortress 2 is that there is always update which contain new items, weapons,weapons changes, maps, gamemodes and THEY ARE ALL FREE OF CHARGE!!! This says when you go on Team Fortress 2, there is always new content to enjoy. TF2 also celebrates special events such as Halloween and particular maps change their looks to match the event. In these events, they are special event only items that you can acquire. Team Fortress 2 are just those games that get very hard to bored of. They can get so addicting that you would just play them all day. NOT TO FORGET, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE HATS. TF2 is an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!!! I give this game overall 1,000,000,000/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Jun 14, 2014, 2:39AM",0,"Jan 19, 2014, 4:49PM",0.8571428571428571,77,"{'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/AnimeGamerFTW,66,AnimeGamerFTW,,11,1687.4,SteveTF2gamer620,0,Recommended,,0,1,0,0,0.7532578438340279,0.78558177

It's all about teams and co-operation and it is absolutely zero fun to play on your own. You will have no idea what is happening and even worse, you will be at a massive disadvantage while playing because everyone else is in teams. Usually you will be trekking along (normally walking for miles since your fully trained soldier can only run about 20 yards before passing out from exhaustion) you'll hear a pop pop from two miles away and then you are dead, and will have to make another 20 minute trek back to the battlefield. Without co-ordination with a very sizable squad of friends then you will always fail. The game is supposed to be ultra realistic but unfortunately this makes for a very poor game. We don't want to fight long distance firefights against invisible enemies with your gun waving around like you've got cerbrial palsy just because you jogged down some steps. The graphics are definitely good, you've got to give it that, but the performance is trash. If you are playing on low to mid settings then the game will be even more difficult - good luck seeing anyone further than 100m away after your LOD turns them into blobs. Literally the only joy I've gotten out of this game is driving trucks around and flying helicopters, but since this is supposed to be a shooter then that is not good. Actually fighting other players or even the AI in the campaign is massively frustrating. My  Mexican friend who made me buy this owes me 44.99.

I know this is just a beta and i have only played a few hours on this game, i have encountered problems which i dont know whether I am terrible at managing arsenal or that the bugs are really messing me up. 1. Lots and LOTS of own goals, it happened that Calum Chambers scored a hatrick of own goals against QPR which ultimately lost me the game. 2. Injuries, injuries everywhere. At least all my players have been injured once since i have been in charge (4months) and it is getting ridiculous. Debuchy was injured for 3 months then i played him once he got fit and got injured again for another 2. It is getting out of hand. 3. Goalkeepers. Where do i begin? Goalkeepers do the craziest  in the entire world, sometimes it can be funny and other times its frustrating as fwuak. It is also not my own gk aswell when i check other games replay, the goalies can be proper (sorry). Other than those issues this game has been great for me.

Played on normal and the difficulty was far too great for me to find fun. I respect this game and feel its good and everything, but even on the lowest difficulty I find it near impossible to find and shoot the enemy. Gun sway is really intense, and this is with me lagging behind the rest of the AI players walking to preserve energy (im aware of the extra stamina drained when moving crouched). Enemy seems to be able to see through foliage. If you like incredibly difficult things, this game is for you. I took my time to do the tutorial, learn the buttons, positioned myself carefully and usually just ended up getting shot. Theres time compression thank god, however a lot of people might not even realize its there. This game has its moments, but I would recommend Operation Flashpoint Red River over this any day, I find it much more satisfying moment to moment. I am an adult with a full time job, walking through the woods simulator isnt my thing, I gave this game a chance and I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life yesterday. I want to love this game as much as the original operation flashpoint...but I can't, I simply can't (in cleetus voice). Graphically things went well, I have a gtx 660 and 10 gigs of RAm on an i5, with shadow play on and recording I was getting somewhere between 25-70 FPS. FPS drops intensely around buildings. I am runnning it on ultra settings. If you have a system similar to mine you can be pretty much assured to play at an acceptable framerate. If you have friends to play with turn on OF:Red River. The friend I tried this with was too frustrated with the shooting mechanics to enjoy it. This game is good mind you, but not for me....",,0,"Oct 27, 2014, 5:53AM",0.48780487804878,41,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.25, 'num_achievements_attained': 9, 'num_achievements_possible': 36}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109329669,20,76561198109329669,7.0,21,5.9,Poob,0,Not Recommended,28.0,0,0,8,170,0.7203411275663016,0.6495504

Tl;dr, the game's community is terrible and the multiplayer is full of  mods that barely work, with the occasional gem ruined by the community that inhabits it. For a more detailed review of my free weekend day with the game, read below. After my dad bought arma 3 I thought I would try it out as well. I've been interested in a realistic modern FPS, but they don't really exist in numbers these days. After taking over an hour to install the game, I was able to play the tutorial while tweaking with my video settings. I eventually up to over 30 FPS while looking really good. Then I decided I wanted to try the multiplayer out. What a mistake that was. ARMA 3's player base is actually worse than ARMA 2's in that every single online server is some  reincarnation of the Hunger Games or DayZ without the zombies. I spent about 4 hours trying to have fun in these game modes. But to no avail, I was playing a really bad set of mods set in a gigantic map that might as well be a copy of Just Cause 2's getaway island, all in a modern FPS simulator. It was like trying to play paintball in playground that was clearly a copy of McDonald's playplaces. After some searching, I eventually found a Domination server, which was as close to vanilla ARMA as I was going to get. It was incredibly confusing, there was no tutorial to explain any of the game mechanics/mod additions, and people were wrecking the base's vehicles. I was desperate, so I tried to play anyways. After about 10-15 mins of gameplay I noticed that my FPS was lagging really badly. I had just found a team of coordinated players though, so I just tried to play through the pain. After the 5 of us singlehandedly took the next objective, everyone was complaining about FPS issues and I was getting 13-18FPS. There was clearly something wrong, but luckily for us a moderator just got on! He reset the server for us, which I thought was really nice. But it was to no avail. Everyone was still having FPS issues, and I guess that has to do with ARMA 3's terrible optimization and/or the custom map's or plugin's memory leakage filling up our RAM. Then, I encountered a new problem. The moderator. He was especially grumpy, and clearly over 40, so being so out-of-touch with not understanding everything he was getting really upset at all of the new players. He understandably kicked a new player that was spamming the minigun on our helicopter even after the moderator told him to stop. And then I got kicked for no reason, presumably because I was also in the helicopter? I came back in, told him that he kicked the wrong guy, and the moderator essentially blew me off. Whatever, screw him then. I found a FOB to spawn on that somebody set up on the enemy's flank. I was able to shoot a couple of guys before they shot me off the hillside. I spawn back in, and everyone is doing awesomely. The enemy has a Frogfoot firing missiles and bombs into the city, the Warthog is doing the same thing, we had mortars, they had mortars, and I was able to move into the town because it was getting absolutely hammered. So I set up shop in a 2nd story window down a street when I spot a couple of soldiers. I aimed at thier bodies but couldn't see a IFF tag so I shot one of them. After the other part of this ambushed squad came back out in the open, I shot another one. I was unsure about whether they were friend or foe still, so I kept an eye out for server messages in the lower-right corner. Loe and behold, this guy was a friendly, and I just shot him. The other guy must've been a friendly too, which means that I accidently killed 2 of my teammates. I immediately said sry on Side Chat, but it was too late. Apparently the immature community that seems to make up ARMA 3's multiplayer though it would be funny to set up a special plugin for teamkillers. Whether it was an accident or not, after 2-3 TKs you are immediately teleported away from the game and your position in the town to some prison with several annoying soundbites going on in the background, and nothing to look at but other TKers and a really low-quality repeated billborad of some kind. After I sat there for a few moments, I was also wearing pink clothing that had TEAM KILLER printed all over it. And there was a soundbite of a baby crying, because that's how annoying the moderators wanted to be. In short, I accidently made a mistake, and was punished in the most immature way possible. By being imprisoned in an annoying micspam room with nothing to do for 6 minutes. Wow. In every other FPS you either lose a bunch of points, get kicked, or are killed by the server.

K'Lem was not a bad khajiit, but K'Lem liked to collect things. This is a story of K'Lem collecting things. K'Lem had come into a land called Skyrim in K'Lem's quest for the collection of things, and because of the  legion imperial scum, K'Lem had lost all of the many things K'Lem's had collected, but that is not this story. And so K'Lem had to begin K'Lem's collection anew. The legion scum had even attempted to kill K'Lem, but that is not this story. And what's more, sometime in K'Lem's recent past in a story that is also not this story, K'Lem was found to be a thing called dragonborn, and because of this, K'Lem was given a servant called Lydia. K'Lem was not sure how this happened, but K'Lem was glad, for Lydia could carry many things, though she did not seem to like K'Lem very much. K'Lem needed a place to store the many collections of things that K'Lem planned to acquire. K'Lem had lost all of K'Lem's things and coins, and the local places were far more costly than the coins K'Lem had, and so K'Lem decided to earn coins doing favors for the locals. These favors bade K'Lem west, and so that is where K'Lem and Lydia set paw. Very soon, K'Lem and Lydia came upon a fort filled with bad men. Bandits they called themselves. They were bandit scum. K'Lem was smart and thought it wise to avoid such men that called themselves this, and so K'Lem carved a wide path around the fort. However, the bandit scum were quick to attack regardless of K'Lem's unprovocations, and Lydia was quick to reciprocate. And K'Lem felt it K'Lem's duty to join Lydia in her reciprocation. K'Lem and Lydia fell the bad bandit scum with much mightiness! The scum fell easily before the might of K'Lem and Lydia! What wonderful moons that blessed K'Lem and Lydia that day! What's more, the bandits had things! Many things! Shiny things and not so shiny things! And K'Lem was smart and had an idea. K'Lem need not collect all of the things! K'Lem could sell some of the lesser things to buy his collection place! Maybe even this fort would provide enough lesser things to afford the place! Thus it was that K'Lem and Lydia set paw inside the fort in search of more bandit scums and their things. Inside the fort, K'Lem and Lydia were sneaky and killed many scums. The scum bandits fell easily in this way, one and two at a time. But they also found a not scum inside. There was a nice Nord lady that gave talk and niceness, and K'Lem was not a bad khajiit, so K'Lem and Lydia let the nice Nord lady be. Soon, K'Lem and Lydia came upon a mighty bandit scum that called itself thug bandit. Thug bandit was very mighty, indeed, and hurt K'Lem time and again. One swing of thug bandit's mighty two-handed hurty thing made K'Lem's head go fuzzy like too much skooma. The battle was hard fought and very long, and it took Lydia distracting thug bandits attention while K'Lem shot thug bandit with arrows for thug bandit to fall. The mightiness of K'Lem and Lydia had vanquished the entire bandit band! And K'Lem was glad and gave thanks to the moons, and relished in K'Lem's victory and all the many things K'Lem had won. But K'Lem and Lydia could not carry all the things. There were too many things! But, Whiterun was still in sight, and K'Lem was smart and K'Lem had another idea. K'Lem decided to return with Lydia to Whiterun to sell all the things KLem and Lydia could carry. KLem planned to quickly return to the fort to collect the rest of the things. K'Lem was amazed at K'Lem's smartness! K'Lem had not finished exploring the fort, however, and K'Lem was most curious about the unknown upstairs, and so K'Lem ran with most haste to Whiterun, and KLem and Lydia ran with such speed that even the deer were amazed! However, when K'Lem returned, the  legion emperial scum had taken over! As if they had been waiting to move in! The fort was completely renovated by the imperial scum, and all K'Lem's hard won things were gone! All of the things! Whats more, the  scum had gall enough to tell K'Lem that K'Lem did not belong! That K'Lem should leave! But this was K'Lem's hard-won fort! K'Lem was not a bad khajiit, but K'Lem had lost all his hard-won things, and so K'Lem was angered, and K'Lem decided to take the legion scums things as payment. And so, once again K'Lem and Lydia were sneaky in the fort, and they took all the things they could carry while avoiding the  legion scums. And the nice Nord lady was still there serving the imperial scums. K'Lem thought that maybe she must come with the fort. Certainly K'Lem could not leave without exploring the unknown upstairs and satiating K'Lem's curiosity, and so K'Lem went to the unknown upstairs to find that the  imperial captain had made it his own place. And as K'Lem was looking and wondering what the unknown upstairs was like when it was the mighty and worthy thug bandits own place, the  legion captain attacked K'Lem! For trespassing! This was K'Lem's hard-won fort and K'Lem was being attacked by the  legion imperial captain scum! But captain scum was no match for mighty K'Lem, and  captain fell easily! And captain scum had so many things for K'Lem to take! And K'Lem was no longer angered. K'Lem and Lydia went downstairs to leave the fort while carrying all the things K'Lem and Lydia could carry. The  soldiers were still hostile, however, and one of them attacked K'Lem for trespassing! Soon all the  soldier legion scum were attacking K'Lem and Lydia! Many soldiers! At least 8! But they were no match for mighty K'Lem and Lydia! Even 15 against K'Lem and Lydia! Or maybe it was 25! Mighty K'Lem and Lydia vanquished them all! K'Lem no longer wondered why the  legion imperials had moved in with such haste. Certainly they had been no match for the mighty thug bandit, and they needed a mighty warrior like K'Lem and Lydia to vanquish the bandits before they could move in. K'Lem decided the  legion scums deserved the death they received and K'Lem was glad. Then it was time for KLem and Lydia to gather all the hard-won things to collect and sell, but this time K'Lem took no chances and weighed KLem and Lydia down with everything in the fort. All of the things. All of the many imperial things. And it was a very long and tiring and laborious short trip to Whiterun. And that is the story of how K'Lem bought K'Lem's collection place.",,0,"Mar 13, 2015, 9:01AM",0.6666666666666661,57,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.08333333333333301, 'num_achievements_possible': 24, 'num_achievements_attained': 2}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/contentiously,38,contentiously,33.0,19,474.4,Contentiously,0,Recommended,18.0,156,6,16,436,0.7258120367543764,0.7700153

If you like playing public multiplayer, don't bother. 90% of the community is made up of kids from the age of 5-14. Not even joking. It's rare to find a 15+ year old on this game, and even more rare to find a mature one. You could always play singleplayer, but the problem is that singleplayer gets boring quite quickly. Actually, it's pretty hard to find someone who is truely mature in this game and doesn't have anger issues or has a voice which can break a wine glass. Of course, if you don't mind little kiddies, or you are one yourself, go right ahead and buy this game. I'm sure you'll have fun with it, I know I did.

I recommend this game to any and all casual gamers, especially fans of light, friendly games and their community, like Club Penguin and 4 ch. an. Also, characters in this game are very easy to learn and their abilities are easy to utilize, allowing easy collaboration with teammates and friends, for example: Meepo the Geomancer is a great character for those new to the game, and I recommend all new players choose him. There's minor drawbacks in useful content though, like certain things are outright useless (like Couriers and Support characters) and they should be removed from the game to make it perfect and this is coming from a long term investor of this game who has dedicated many hours (1337, to be exact) to this extremely fun indie game.

The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that.

Can't really compare it to any other game. Arma is just Arma, period. xD If you haven't played arma before then you migh think that this is the game about shooting or operating armored vehicles, but no, not really. Most of the time you will run around some forests trying to spot the enemy and figure out how to take them out. Then you probably gonna be spoted by the enemy and be dead in a seconds. Repeat. Playing this game requires strategic thinking - you can't just take gun and take enemy out, no, it doesn't work that way. This game features two maps: big and huge, including towns, forests, mountains, flat fields and graaaas grass grass. Yeah, i love grass in this game - looks fantastic. xD So... Where was i? oh, right, the map is big and you can go by your feet or take armored vehicles, civilian vehicles, helicopters or planes... You gonna waste time to get to destination point and after hour of travelling there you will be shot by some weirdo in the woods. Repeat. Anyway, this is nice game(yet you need some great rig to run it) with limitless editor and mod support. Best expirience achieved in coop missions with friends. Team Work is necessary. Pros: +Limitless warfare simulator +Graphics looks beatiful 80% of the time +in-game editor allows you to create your own missions +Steam workshop support: download missions created by other users or get more weapons and vehicles. +It's not CoD +It's not BF4 either +Bugs are fun Cons: -It's probably boring for players from other shooter games -Limitless CPU usage: your cpu will cry like a ith during the 100 vs. 100 battle with tanks and helis. -Graphics doesn't look beautiful 20% of the time. -Not so big default weapon arsenal(but there are mods, hey) -Multiplayer performance sucks sausage -Campaign is not open world and not coop as it was in Arma 2 -Bugs are still bugs even if they're fun -AI has IQ equal to chair. Or maybe table. P.S. Did you really read it all? Lol. If you consider yourself as a ""hardcore fps shooter player and cod is for kids bla bla bla"" - try arma, waste your time, enjoy true hardcore.

Did I say Space Ninjas? It's really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target. If you ever wanted to be Bruce Lee; this is your game. It has boss fights with actual strategies, plenty of unlocks to find, lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere. The new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about, but is as easy as Paper, Rock, Scissors in it's simplest form. Weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle. Alternative playstyles such as Stealth plays a prominent role in Warframe. You can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows! You can choose between Support frames, Offensive frames, and Defensive frames for a mission. Invite your buddies or grab some guys / gals from the recruiting social channel. If you want to meet new people, join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space! You have multiple saved loadout slots for free! Digital Extremes doesn't really nickle and dime you in this game like other F2P games. They do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items, XP boosters, warframe slots, weapon slots, and materials for those too busy to go fight. Nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them. They give away the best guns for free during those events. They have a XP system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes. Leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the XP necessary to unlock the sickest weapons! This is a Play to Win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient, but you can just play more and get it. Isn't playing the game the purpose of it? Of course you can buy completed Warframes for real money, but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free. Of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it. At less than $1 a slot, no subscription fee, and no initial game purchase, this sounds like the steal of the century. And you don't have to buy them and still have fun, but it's nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort.

What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map Ive seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community. What you dont get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If youre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If youre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless. Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more? Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience. Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isnt the game youre looking for. Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign  those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but dont expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before  the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime. Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, Id certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it. I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that Im not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some.","Dec 23, 2013, 1:30AM",0,"Dec 20, 2013, 9:16AM",0.8601694915254231,472,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971414496,406,76561197971414496,,66,130.3,HOFF 9000,0,Recommended,,0,4,0,0,0.7685147906327088,0.81600827

I have to say this year, there are way more bugs then every other years. I played 50 hours in the first 3 days of the release of the beta version and I spotted about 10 problems. Because this is my favourite game I just keep playing and identify bugs in the bugs forum so my favourite game can be fixed. Yet, I waited after two updates, the game is still not fixed. Bugs that are still not fixed: - After stadium expansion plan got cancelled, the finishing date still highlight on the calendar. - Rooney get unhappy because pre season training start too early even though it is nearly december. - Defenders with at least 15 pace and 15 acceleration chase down the ball that has passed the defenders line ridiculously slow. THIS IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING BUG. HOW CAN PHIL JONES OR JONNY EVANS OR RAFAEL CHASE DOWN A BALL SO SO SO SLOW, IT IS PRETTY MUCH SLOWER THAN OTHERS WALKING. THE OPPONENT END UP GETTING BALL EASILY SINCE THE DEFENDERS CAN'T EVEN GET THE BALL WITH 50 METRES HEAD START. Throughout the 3 seasons, I've seen this occurred 20 times, so I'm quitting until it is fixed. - Set-piece marking is completely broken, i set pretty much all my players to defend, 3 form wall and 7 markers against 5 opponent. Yet 3 out of 5 opponents are completely unmarked and freely roaming around on the side of my wall. - Team selection layout maybe a minor issue, but it can be annoying if you have a big squad or you want to pick someone in the youth team. There used to be a sub slots column next to starting formation/line up, now it it gone. You now have to drag a player from the players list to the substitute slots on the same list. Picking substitute has never been harder in my life. - Budget adjustment in my first season at ManUtd, I can adjust the transfer budget to zero so i can have 3.6 Mil per week for wage budget. The second season, i adjust it all the way to wage budget, but i can only get 3 Mil per week wage budget. So that means my minimum transfer budget is 60 MIL. I'm paying players 3 Mil wage per week so whats the point of having maximum 3 Mil for wage budget and 60 Mil for transfer budget? Why can't I have all my transfer budget all my wage budget? - There are many more... I have posted all the bugs I've spotted on the bugs forum but all i get is pissy tone replies or thread closed for lacking evidence. They expect me to download this thing so I can post the game file on the server for them, and I've try installing it on my mac countless of time, it failed to install. Not to mention it is sponsored by MACKEEPER, A FREAKING MAC VIRUS. I tried to posted screenshot on the forum, it never works. They recommended this other software which has 2 weeks trial for free, DO I HAVE TO PAY TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY THE BUGS? I tried upload so videos of the bugs so my thread doesn't get close down, and i get all these pissy replies. Since there server doesn't work, i upload the game file on a file hosting website, they still expect me to upload it on a server that never works on my mac. Mostly unappreciated replies when I'm trying to help them, occasionally I get a nice reply but I am very unhappy with the game. I save up my pocket money to preorder it, paypal converted the money to profit them, I got charged by banks with overdrawn fee and I get a game full of rubbish.",,0,"Nov 13, 2014, 7:00PM",0.8,25,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068959234,20,76561198068959234,,5,165.3,dtk656,0,Not Recommended,,0,0,0,0,0.6625280399248491,0.6477252

Basic info. Genre: Action Brief summary In Team Fortress 2, the player can choose to play as 9 different character classes, all of which feature a unique set of attributes, customizable weapons and special equipment, join a team of other players and either compete with an opposing team for a principal objective or cooperate with their teammates against an AI. Critical commentary | Essential value: Pros & Cons Pros: It's an examplatory multiplayer FPS game. It's F2P. The cartoon-like in-game graphics are cool. The soundtrack is really amazing. It's an excellent way to get socialised and to meet fellow gamers, since its community is gigantic and evergrowing. There are at least 2-3 major updates per year, including annual Halloween and Christmas events, and several bug fixes once in a while. It features 500+ well-made Steam Achievements. It provides the player with the ability to adapt the characters' loadouts to their personal combat preferences and capabilities by fully customizing them, as well as to dress their mercenaries with several cosmetic items. Thus, they are able to create an ideal combination of items that will maximize their potential. There are multiple types of game categories (including Capture the Flag, Control Point, King of the Hill, Payload etc), as well as various maps and levels, and as a result it's almost impossible for the player to get bored. Cons: It requires money in order to upgrade your account to premium, to buy most of the fancy, nonetheless useless and unnecessary, gear and, in general, to take part in the main economic system. At the beginning, it seems difficult and complicated due to the vast variety of weapons, equipment and cosmetic items, maps and locations. However, the more you play the game, the easier and the simpler it becomes. It may become extremely addictive.

Pretty much the same as the others but upgraded. More animations and more....animations. More features as well, apparently, but we'll get to that soon. I was excited for FM 2015, as i normally am whenever a new version comes out. I start up a save where i'm unemployed with a Sunday League reputation. This time i have to think about the coaching badges as well. I don't want any. I will start at the very bottom. Then i experience some RPG attribute thingy. Am i a tracksuit manager or a tactical manager? Hell if i know. I am both but according to the game i kind of have to choose one or the other. I like the idea but i find it a bit too gimmicky. Loading up every single league the game comes with, and a large database. Takes me about 15 minutes before i can start playing for real. The game progresses smoothly. No problems being over the recommended player limit, yet. I'm in the year 2025 now and still no problem. Granted, it slows down a bit when changing months, changing year and during transfer deadline days; but i expected that. Playing the game itself is a bit like a tiny rollercoaster ride. I love playing the game but there are so many tiny bugs and features that don't work very well. Sidebar. I don't mind it but it gives me less room for customised screens. While on the subject customised screens; A complete mess. I ""warned"" them about these kind of things on SI's forums. Small tiny bugs like these might seems small but they will come back and be a bigger issue. It's been there for a long, long time and they haven't done anything about it. It wasn't prioritised and now they're struggling to figure out how to fix it. Go figure Customising screens is a nightmare. Columns disappearing left and right, when you have plenty of room on the screen. You just want to adjust the width of one column a few mm. ""POOF"" an entire column or two, gone. Very annoying, as i customise most of my screens. Player interactions are just a complete mess and do not work properly. An entire team in outrage because a 17-year old, who wouldn't get anywhere near the bench of my local 10th-tier real-life club. Amazing. Nobody would care. Not even the 17-year old himself. Players complaining that they want to play more games. We are in the middle of the bleeding holidays. We don't have another game for 3 months. Then comes back and wants to leave because i didn't keep my promise of playing him. We're still one and a half month away from our first friendly. Then, when i try to sell him, he complains that i'm trying to force him out of the club. Well....kind of, yeah?! You wanted to leave becuase of playing time and me not keeping promises, so now you want to leave, because i was trying to let you leave because you wanted to? Player interactions is a big mess. One big negative from me is: Tactics screen. Lord, oh lord, what have they done?! FM14 had the close-to-perfect tactics screen and then they change it, for no apparent reason. Change it to something a thousand times worse. Now, to be fair, they have updated the tactics screen with their patches, so it looks a bit better. To a new player, i don't know what to say. I, personally, don't like the tactics screen at all. I simply don't use it. Backroom advice. My coaches are still offering me contradicting advice. Why the hell would i want my left fullback dribble on the right hand side when you just told me to train him so he doesn't do that anymore?! I could write a whole lot more about the ups and downs with this game but i'll just do this: I do enjoy the game quite a bit, but it's not the best FM. Far away from it. Another not-complete version of this game, which i am getting a bit tired of. It seems like it's acceptable that this is always a game in progress. It will always be in progress and i understand that. But each released version should feel like a complete product. It doesn't, and it hasn't done that for a long time. People on the forums wants features and more features. On one hand they get applauded for doing so, but when things aren't working so well they get the defenders shouting, they're just a small company. If they're not so big then stop adding so many features. Stop adding more than they can handle, which seems to be the case, more and more each year. More features doesn't equal better product. It also needs to work properly, which it doesn't. This seems like an overly negative review, and it kind of is. But i have to say that i do enjoy this iteration as well. I'll still have, probably, over a thousand hours in this game, when FM16 comes out. Having a lot of fun. Finding it harder, personally, than any other version but i love the challenge. I do recommend this game. Make no mistake about that!!! I'll leave this review with the things that bothers me the most about this FM2015: Cons: - Player interactions doesn't work properly - Tactics screen X 1000. It's just many steps back from what they had. - Issue with getting players match fit in lower leagues - Too easy overacheiving when you have the right tactic (compared to real life) - Scouting is very tedious and doesn't work properly - Customising screens doesn't really work",,0,"Dec 24, 2014, 2:34AM",0.60377358490566,53,"{'num_achievements_attained': 46, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.43809523809523804, 'num_achievements_possible': 105}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/roykela,32,roykela,17.0,21,1764.1,roykela,0,Recommended,23.0,31,0,5,544,0.6496882120812618,0.5760532

The turn-based system is quite fair, though a little bit does rely on luck if you're playing multiplayer (Who gets to host is 1st player, and thus gets ""Priority"" on wonders, so if both you and player 1 have 1 turn left on The Great Library, Player 1 will get it first), but I personally play a lot of singleplayer. The bot difficulty level increases at a high rate as you go up - 1 is basically playing against yourself, 2 may be challenging for someone learning the game, 3 is an ok difficulty, though still a bit easy, 4 is the equivalent of a moderately skilled human player, and 5 has the tactic of a skilled player, plus extra science/food/production, so I personally play on level 4. I won't go into details about levels 6-8, because I've never tried them, nor do I plan to in the near future. The UI is quite user-friendly - If there is an action that needs to be done, it will show up in the lower-right corner just above the minimap. There are 4 ""advisors"" that help new players understand what to build, and how it will benefit them, as well as whether or not to attack an enemy unit, and even who you may stand a chance against in a total war! Spies also add a new level of strategy to the game, as you must decide whether you will try to steal technology from other people, or if you will protect your own technology. Then you add spy promotions, in which Recruits will almost always be beaten by Agents, who will almost always be beaten by Special Agents. By changing spies around that have different promotions, you can achieve a different level of defense and offense in espionage. For example, if you want to steal from a country that has lots of tech, but you just want intrigue about another nation that has little tech, you can send your Special Agent over to the country that has lots of tech, and your Recruit to the other nation. Overall, this is a really fun game, the only drawback is it's price, but if it ever goes on sale, it is definitely worth picking up if you're into strategy games.",,0,"Oct 16, 2014, 6:50PM",0.927272727272727,55,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.30000000000000004, 'num_achievements_attained': 3, 'num_achievements_possible': 10}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/GriffonDefender,51,GriffonDefender,16.0,4,279.2,GriffonDefender,1,Recommended,24.0,18,1,8,56,0.7366229899899289,0.7778794

The work they've done is great and is easily worth the game cost alone. However, craftsmanship aside, this is a bit better than GTA4 technically speaking, but not better than GTA3: San Andreas immersion/story-wise. - Its a bit of a cheap gimic for game makers to ""let"" users create their own content (movie mode). That was a novel idea back when minecraft came out... now its just lazy. - The missions feel cobbled together and the character switching requirement/feature causes immersion loss. - Main characters are as deep as a kiddy pool, and supporting characters are mostly just annoying and not lovable. + Trevor, however, was really well done! + Graphics, controls, cars, city, diversity, engine, optimization are all cinima grade awesome. All in all, its fun to screw around GTA2 style, but at $260-ish million development budget... they could have done considerably better.

If you want to take a few minutes from your time, you can listen to my storyThe first time I played this, was around late december 2007 on my brothers old windows vista computer. It didnt have much on it; weapons, hats, unusauls, etc...I'd played it a few times over at friend's houses and watched it change. New gamemodes, servers, weapons, etc...and how that all Changed the gameplay balance. I didn't get my own steam till about 3 years ago, and I was only going to use it for garry's mod. Then I decided oh what the hell, I guess I'll download tf2 since it's free. I'd been playing it on the xbox 360 for about a year then (by the way it sucks on that.) And I remember my first game, feeling sweetness as I got an insane killstreak on 2fort...like 50 something kills in less than 7 minutes. I hadn't been using steam much at the time, but around late August 2012, I'd really started to get into things. I found out about trading, and the tf2 economy, and getting cool hats for your characters, and the new mvm update which I mainly play right now. Then, when my friend told me about unusuals in tf2, everything ing changed. In late december 2012, i was doing everything I could to get one of these so claimed unusuals. They had these like cool particle effect thingys coming out of them. Finally, from the help of a steam buddy of mine, I was able to get one. The very first unusual I owned was a steaming handyman's handle. Now I know you're thinking, ""haha a 10 key hat? So what?"" But at the time, I didn't care if it was worth jack squat. It just felt so good to have that thingy with steam emmitting out of it. Then soon after that I got earbuds, and a bills hat, and some strange festives. And then, around my sprnig break in 2013, I got scammed out of my unusual. My only unusual...And the guy who did it, I wanted to ing rip his head off I hated him so much. I will give his name out: balestorm1, although he's been offline for over a year now. He's a really interesting guy, Did a scamming spree of like 6 unusual hats. Back to my story now. After that I traded my earbuds for a second unusual hat. A stormy pith helm for solly. It looked pretty cool as well, I then started trading up to make profit, and by early summer 2013, I already had about $1000 worth of items. A whole summer went by dedicated towards making profit and spending more of my money on unusuals/stranges, etc...but after reaching what seemed like my full mental capacity for trading, I started to feel sad, and lonely, and withdrawn from the everthing else (I'm not kidding.) I decided I should probably cash out of tf2 to get money and such for it all. I did end up getting around 500 u.s. dollars via paypal, but I still had a whole bunch of . After doing that...I traded towards an awesome burning Dapper's for soldier of which i favorited, then i traded and traded till in finally decided to spycrab what was primarily left of my backpack. Not alot, but something. ~4 buds worth of  I lost in multiple spycrabs on the MCT/Pink Taco's trading server. During all that, I was also taking a long break from tf2 as well going into several gmod communities, I even made my own server with a buddy of mine. That is a different story though. All the trading has put aside a focus for the core gameplay. I feel like this is how it is for many others who play this game as well. Several updates ago, I was getting really  at the game, and with this new Love and War, or Bread and Conga (lol not) update, It really  me off for multiple reasons. And for like the 6th time, I said ""I'M DONE WITH TF2. I'M NEVER PLAYING THIS  OF A GAME AGAIN."" But here I am, amidst all this chaos...Standing strong I prevail through all of this. I know, no matter what, this game, with it's mystery will be my all time favorite video game.","Jun 22, 2014, 12:01AM",1,"Jun 20, 2014, 7:42PM",0.764705882352941,17,"{'num_achievements_possible': 29, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.5862068965517241, 'num_achievements_attained': 17}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/thiswebsiteisgarbage,13,thiswebsiteisgarbage,108.0,4,2103.3,Stouter,0,Recommended,52.0,546,11,13,80,0.73752392575862,0.7415904

Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading. This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with. So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game: Pros -This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing. -Free to play with optional cosmetic costs. -Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously. -Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer. -Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game. Cons -This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA. -Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of ""fundamentals of gameplay"" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions. -There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier. This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.

And you dont pay player worth 50k more than 500k, but in this manager you pay it for more than 5M. - Players atributes: I wasn't sure before but i am now, they are crap. In my team i have strikers with amazing attributes for strikers and hey cant score if their life depend on it, but on the other side strikers in other teams with crappy attributes score 20+ goals in season like they play in minor league - Interviews: If i wanted to read that much and respond to all those questions i would buy a book or go to online chat and not waste money on this game. I feel like i am playing Celebrity manager instead Football - AI: now this is special story, in last manager it was bad bit it was managable, in this on it is so bad that i want to ask for refund of my money.

ArmA, ArmA, ArmA. The abusive relationship we have shared over the past 4 games has become more abusive, and less fun, and all it took was one title. One title full of empty promises, and most likely just a tech demo to fix the engine up for DayZ 2. Let me elaborate on my disdain for what used to be one of my favorite game series, and the company that I used to respect above every other. The quick and dirty, would I recommend ArmA 3? Not by a mile. Sub-30 price tag, sure, you'll get your monies worth. But even for all the modders trying to save it, this is not a complete game. You should not have to pay 60 dollars to go and download a number of COMMUNITY created additions to feel like you actually have a full fledged product. If some of that money went to those modders, then I'd say support THEM, not BI. But it doesn't. Imagine buying a car, but having to go out and purchase the doors and steering wheel separately. Sure the car runs, but just how useable is it? A quick glance at my steam page would reveal that I highly praised BI's adventurous approach to ArmA 2, and OA. I loved ArmA with a blazing passion, even though it's considered the  of the series. OFP shared a warm place in my heart as the birth of one of my favorite mil-sims. Sure, since OFP, the series has had its caveats and nuances, but you quickly learned to take them with the massive amount of fun the games provided. So where did ArmA 3 go wrong? What could one title do to tear my respect for 3 other games (+ 2 Expansions & DLC)? Well, lets start with the company and work our way up. You see, riding on the heels of the massive success that DayZ was thanks to word of mouth and LPs, BI somewhere seems to have got it in their head that the same business practices most AAA companies do (Incomplete Games for Full Price, DLC strategies), could be done to their small communities. And you know what? They were right. We all bought into it. BI slowly came to realize that they could do less work, and still make more money, because their communities could turn nowhere else. What amazes me most about DayZ, besides the fact that it is still in Alpha after almost 2 years, and that it's lead creator left, is that all it really did was show what ArmA 2 was already capable of. Massive, persistent worlds with Mil-Sim themes. Just, with zombies. But, this is not a review of DayZ, this a review of ArmA 3. Any ArmA community member worth his or her grain of salt will remember all the broken promises that now lay at ArmA 3's feet. Disguising as the enemy? Gone. The Railgun tank, one of the coolest features at E3, and the only one making the future worth giving a damn about? Poof. All the underwater showcases, hinting at perhaps real naval gameplay? Nope. Planes? We got 3. Funny thing is, all you Deluxe Edition owners should open up that Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures manual it comes with sometime, and view all the planes we should have had. The reskinned C-130 and F-35? Fugetta about it. That's right, we couldn't even get recycled content. Now, let me be fair, ArmA 3's engine is a massive improvement over previous series entries. And OFP/ArmA has always been one of those games where the community really takes it the final step with endless content. But Vanilla, the games were usually very playable, and very enjoyable. This is where ArmA 3 comes up the shortest. While the engine is great, and getting better with each patch, not only are we still denied even a basic amount of content, but the underlying issues since OFP are still there. 2013/2014, we still have an action menu. BI, please. Not to mention that AI has somehow found a way to get worse with all these improvements, rather than better. You know, some people actually say ArmA 2 people were spoiled because we had OFP and ArmA 1's content all rolled into one. I find it hard to give sympathy to the people whose job it is to create content and games. Who get paid for it. In closing I will say this. ArmA 3, as a game, is complete and total BS. ArmA 3, as a platform, for people to show their skills in modeling, texturing, and coding, fantastic. If you want ArmA 3, do it to support people who make great content.

This has nothing to do with CounterStrike anymore but if you prefer to play a casual CoD clone, you might be happy though.","Mar 28, 2014, 3:22PM",0,"Mar 28, 2014, 3:14PM",0.5882352941176471,17,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.9461077844311371, 'num_achievements_attained': 158}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/nordic89,10,nordic89,6.0,7,1925.5,Nordic,0,Not Recommended,133.0,0,1,2,18,0.7051440015667109,0.6068309

However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any fun out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state. Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"" , sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair . I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example. 9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't hormonal teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and or homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be hard if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire, I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature a lot . I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't. By the way, to be genuinely good at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive , you must own at least one expensive weapon skin, or better yet, a $300 virtual knife. They seem to be the major factor in judging ones skills these days(!). The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community.","Mar 16, 2015, 5:44AM",0,"Jan 17, 2015, 11:03AM",0.7025948103792411,501,"{'num_achievements_possible': 22, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.09090909090909001, 'num_achievements_attained': 2}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo,352,AroNocebo,25.0,149,283.2,Aro,1,Not Recommended,154.0,80,26,67,325,0.7300380309880036,0.72005343

This is the first year i have felt cheated out of my money. Where to start. the new side bar makes things complicated for no reason whatsoever. the old system was fine and didnt need changing, It might just be me but the whole feel of the game has a far more fake feel about it while at the same time trying to add an unnecessary amout of realism. I know this is a game but i somehow felt more connected to players and staff in the old one. then you get to the matches. The worst part of the game however is the god awful match engine. The players look like chickens with flapping arms, opposition goalkeepers appear to be the lovechild of neuer and buffon, whereas mine has all the ability of a paraglegic. My defnders seem to think that marking from corners means marking the corner of the six yard box and not moving and the guys on the posts are superglued there. I took charge of manchester united, incredible attack and i added well too, yet my team had no answers to the might of the mls teams on tour pre season, i went back over these games tried various formations and even went as far as using the in game editor to make all my players level20 on everything and still we were soundly beaten. this seems to be a big flaw from other reviews i have read too, as does the crazy scorelines, i managed to pull off a 7-6 win over southampton with their cb scoring a hattrick from corners due to afforementioned problems and another fabulous 8-5 win over qpr after being 4-0 up and going behind 4-5. It has so many issues right now it is just not worth the outlay. Top and bottom, if you have fm14, do not buy this game, udpade the players and enjoy as it is superior to this in every way.","Nov 9, 2014, 1:38PM",0,"Nov 7, 2014, 7:34PM",0.518518518518518,27,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024401320,14,76561198024401320,,13,735.4,drdave2210,0,Not Recommended,,0,0,0,0,0.705828049806238,0.672334

The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further. Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system. Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker. This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this.

But i just can't deal with it anymore. 80+ hours I've spent in the game and it just feels like wasted time. Yes, the graphics are vastly improved, but that comes with a lot of sacrifices. Firstly, you have to have about fourteen gtx titans to run this game properly. I have a pretty decent pc (most games at high/max settings) yet Arma just does not want to play smoothly. I get about 30fps in arma 3 and although that's perfectly playable, the framerate drops and it is a pain to play. ""I'll just ignore the framerate drops"", i said to myself. ""So what if it drops, it's a great game"" but the game consistenly crashes. It just happened to me in wasteland, right behind someone with top gear and bam. Arma3.exe has stopped working. It's not like this is an occasional thing either, it happens at least once every time I play. And don't even get me started on the driving, its like trying to wade a kite through custard, seriously. Also, the fact theres about 3 (ok maybe more) guns really annoys me. There's about 3/4 assault rifles and they all perform pretty much the same, there's no quirks with each, they're all just.. bland. That goes the same for pretty much every weapon class. That's without me mentioning the fact none of them are liscensed or have official names. I know its a ""futuristic"" world, but I much prefered the ak47's, Pkms, m4's etc of arma 2. Have i mentioned the fact only one campaign episode has been released?

A gem gameplay wise. It's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try. That was the short version. If that didn't convince you yet, move along. The mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique: While one class is able to perform a Mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters. The variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. And believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk DOES make a difference. Talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being ""pay to win"" options - not in Team Fortress 2. Owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic. This makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~40 minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste. Combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways. There's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind. I guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-FPS-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something I greatly appreciate, for that's what I personally feel titles like Call of Duty are lacking. There's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: Minor annoyances. Eventually they don't spoil your overall expirience. Although 7 years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored. So, to recap: Whether you are casually or competitively motivated, whether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots, whether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping, whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish, you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game. And yeah. The only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download. 9.5/10, would will play again.",,2,"Dec 27, 2013, 4:46PM",0.7906976744186041,43,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.826254826254826, 'num_achievements_attained': 428}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLairOfTheChair,34,TheLairOfTheChair,8.0,9,3122.2,22nd Sentry Gentleman,0,Recommended,122.0,136,2,1,21,0.7399983509417558,0.777544

The multiplayer is ungodly imbalanced. Cheaters 24/7. hacked lobbies, etc,etc. All that we couldve expected. Most of the time the fps eats the damn dirt as well, so optimization isnt that improved from IV. The lack of bulletproof windows makes you an easy target in almost all lobbies. Most weapons are either unpowered, or overpwoered. No balance was considered in this game whats over. I still play but thats becuase im level 82, big whoop. Still fight hacked lobbiers who are level 8000. Overall this game is one big sham, my recomendation, wait until the lobbies die off and then invite some friends. Becuase you can trust randoms with jack . Heists are okay, but the lack uniqueness honestly. I dont like the concept where your forced to use preset clothings on the standard option. I know, i know immersion. But it makes your character appear like a damn clone honestly. The cops are OP. Like...SUPER OP example: Fire a silenced firearm in a desert where nobody can hear you about 5 times....2 stars....and about a 15 minute wait until that goes away out of sight. Even more annoying about the cops is when your trying to take a bounty, or any other pvp stuff in a lobby matched and they focus on only one of you which is annoying as . I hate the concept of the multiplayer lobby having you show up as a bright dot on the map 24/7. I hate, i hate it, i hate it. Theres no privacy, none of it. Yeah yeah yeah. You can disabled the blip with lester. But seriously, when has 1 minute honestly made a ing difference? NOWHERE! My opinion, only allow friends/crew to see your blip. You can keep the nametags up, but why the hell would you add a ing blip permanently? Worst concept i've ever seen in my life. I can see it being only usefull on bounties, friends/crew (as mentioned beforehand.), and players with a high hostility rate. Otherwise, its just a terrible concept. Even more complaints on weapon balance is that rockstar doesnt know WTF their doing. Their version of balancing the weapons is adding free dlc weapons, which are superior to the vanilla weapons, that can be unlocked at the very 1st rank. Example is a lock on missle....the ing thing has more damage than the rpg. Yet it has the ability to lock onto people. Welp, there went balance out the window. Now instead of using a rank lock we might as well be giving miniguns as ing candy. Honestly, dont pay $60 for this in its current state, dont even pay $40...its not worth it...the story is pretty decent, but the MP is just thrown out of propertion. Its a failed state of deciding it wants to be, call of duty with permanent UAV mode on, battlefield name spam 4, the sims (towards customization and money game),hardline's cops and robbers, and a socialness game. It makes no ing sense.....oh not to mention in GTA online you have the durability of a god damn cracker, yet hacked lobby levelers can withstand about 3 shotgun blasts point blank and/or more than half of a AR mag to the chest. With the introduction of heists, everyone is just a damn zombie. instead of brains though their feeding on the most BOOOOOOORING gamemode that is now overused. The heists themselves dont even give you that much RP, and just mostly money. Even then you'll fail about 90 times on just the 2nd heist unless you have level 100s. Meaning your better off doing missions, its faster, and more lucrative in the end. Also the game gets grindy AS  later levels. About 80-100 you'll do about 20 heists fully before you get to 100. In a way its almost like rockstar WANTS you to cheat, just so they can ban all of their own player base. Oh and no MP modding, disappointing.

With any other (steam) game I expected my game progress to be stored in cloud. It is 2015 after all. But oh boy have I ever been so wrong about Rockstar. After starting up the game, I saw the very first mission popping up on my screen. At first I thought it was just some sync issue, maybe I needed to load the files explicitly through Rockstar Social club or something. But no, it is confirmed that this garbage does NOT save your progress in the cloud. It does use cloud for storing your achievements, character progress and some other static data like that, but it seems that Rockstar games was so ing cheap that they did not want to store a few megabytes of binary data per user. That's what you get - in 2015 - from a game's steam release (where they could simply have used steam API for cloud storage) - for 60 ING  So no, don't buy this game on steam if you expect this version to be better than a boxed release or any other  digital store's release.

The game became somewhat dull and continuously repetitive despite the ''updates'' it was getting. Only thing stats changes did was to  up the balance and make me want to play it less. Then there is the updates which added new weapons... Really didn't helped at all, it ed the game even more. Valve saw their precious TF2 that got them so much money from the mann co. microtransactions is dying and they thought adding more stuff to it will make it more interesting and that people will come back running to it because of the new content. Wrong move. Today, The Gun Mettle uptade was release. From now on, 3 July 2015 will mark the day when the TF2 we all knew and loved has died and was replaced with a more cartoonish version of Counter Strike. Good job, Valve. Good job... Edit: Some users might agree with this here, maybe others not, but I'm pretty sure the only way Valve will ever have some of the old TF2 players back in the game is to launch a damn update that removes all this new weapons, stats changes and CS:GO crap. Or atleast some official valve servers for vannila gameplay WITHOUT this  updates. Some of use like then, some don't. Why would you try to get new fans by adding all this  when you had a really huge community backing all of you up!! You had supporters, people that actually loved the game, the vannila one, without all this new updates that completely changed the game's feeling. Or is it that you saw the game is slowly dying and thought adding new stuff will make it last longer? Wrong move. The game is soon becoming as old as 8 years, what made you think a game like this will not eventually die? It happens, you can't avoid it. in' learn that your game is dying and you people are not able to bring it back alive with all this updates which add new content to it. I still do like and support you Valve, you make great games and all that, but sometimes you make some the most horrific and staggering decisions one could make. And I don't wish for you to become like EA or anything close to them. I want you to be the company we all know and love. That's all.

In less than 3 days I finished the main missions and most of the optional side missions (game completion at 75%), without stealing more than 3 cars/vehicles in total (in the stats I have Trevor with one police car stolen and Michael with one FireTruck and a Taxi stolen, Franklin didn't steal no nothing). I also played on the side Online in that game time and reached a Rank over 20, it's great fun with or without friends. It feels like this game is a drug that stole my life...but I don't regret a thing. Things I really enjoyed and you should probably do too: The game, despite it's large size, it's amazingly optimized with many graphic options to tweak. I have exactly the minimum requirements and I can run it, sure I had to turn every fancy pc enchanting option off and it looks like the graphics on the old-gen consoles, but I am happy, it works with +30fps. The missions are really captivating, the money spending system feels more challenging (because you have a lot to spend it on, to invest it, to simly lose it). You get to meet many interesting sidecharacters and the overall voiceacting is really good. Besides the actual story and the many twists in the missions, they have quite a replay value due to their minichallenges for each of them (like 'finish in the required time', 'complete it in a certain order' etc.) if you are a completionist. The car handleing, amazing, the gave up the GTA IV 'simulator' like driving and brought back the arcade like car handling from the older ones, where you can rotate in the air or do some nice stunts. The world is really immersing, each NPC with it's small story, with their interactions etc. It's a living world filled with living people, animals and moments...and with Internet, Radio and Cable TV! I can't quite say there is a lot of choice based tasks, but there is a really decent number of those, most of them involving planning or the interaction choice, but as long as you have imagination there will always be a choice. It's great that we have animals, you can kill them, you can play/interact with them, you can even become them at a certain point (hidden easter egg). Most of the people are avereage aged, from 20-60 or so, I kinda wished we also had the extrems like children or quite old people...sure it would probablly create some controversy, but it would make give the game an even more real feeling.

Before I hear some smarmy child tell me what I should do, or what i did wrong, here is a list of  I have already done: -verified the integrity of the cache, -updated my graphics drivers, -updated visual C redist, -updated directX, -launched the game as administrator, -launched their rockstar social club BS launcher as administrator, -DELETED their rockstar social club launcher and verified AGAIN, -updated my graphics drivers to the BETA drivers, -VERIFIED THE INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE -updated WINDOWS -tried some dubious ini files which MIGHT fix this POS game, or might give me a virus... -disabled GPU and run intel only* -disable windows firewall because WHY NOT!??* DID I MENTION I VERIFIED THE INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE??? oh yeah and I posted a ticket to Rockster support and have received NO response, as well as received no response (ranging to snarky unhelpful responses) from the steam forums...* *UPDATE* i DID hear from rockstar support about a day and a half after i posted the ticket (and after i called them out on Twitter) and here is a list of things they have told me to do which has ALSO not worked: -can you effing believe they told me to verify the integrity of the cache? i'm dead serious -send them a launcher.log file which doesn't exist, located in a folder which doesn't exist -disable my firewall, or switch firewalls (really?) -open an executable they sent me, probably the biggest ray of hope i had was when they sent me the EXE, which were very quickly dashed when i opened it and i gave me a ""sorry, Grand Theft Auto is not installed on this machine, please reinstall."" message I can most assuredly say, without a doubt, that GTA V is installed on my machine. BUT HEY AT LEAST ROCKSTAR PATCHED OUT MOD SUPPORT! ""but wait, if you can't even open the game, how is you have 5 minutes of play?"" from repeatedly opening it, and watching it crash, I generated the 5 minutes of play required to write this review. WHY? because I am that  off, i am that mad, after all the nonsense i heard about Rockstar doing a good port of this game, from different new sites, from different users, from different reviews, the game just DOESN'T WORK. maybe it's something real easy, something real simple, but if that's the case, then that represents how much Rockster screwed up. people need to know, YOU need to know, before you buy this game, that there is a chance that it just may not work, regardless of your machine, and regardless of what you do, the game is still broken. I may amend this review if Rockstar fixes the problem, but honestly i don't know how good the game would have to be to undo the amount of BS i've been put through.

He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Fhrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust. Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy. Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support. Hitler actively sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.",,12,"Dec 4, 2014, 4:11PM",0.5714285714285711,42,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.216666666666666, 'num_achievements_attained': 13, 'num_achievements_possible': 60}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061946957,24,76561198061946957,8.0,18,699.0,Sadseal,0,Recommended,23.0,33,6,8,59,0.8208304338286855,0.86455905

It's worth every $ that it's listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. I have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but I can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content. Here are some key features that hooked me into the game.. 1. Dungeon Complexity - When I say complexity, I mean that the design for the game's dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. You just have to keep exploring and you'll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. At times.. I ALMOST felt as if I were playing the latest Tomb Raider once again. I also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles. 2. Playstyle Freedom - I'm sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. It's definitely a step up compared to games like Kingdoms of Amalur. Do you enjoy melee combat? How about magic? How about a balance of both? There's a lot of possibilities. 3. Expansive Lore - As I've mentioned, the game has a ton of content. Playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quest's lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture. Skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that I really wanted to highlight. They stood out for me and it was for these reasons that I ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. With that said, I paid $30 for the legendary edition. Wouldn't you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? How many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. Just remember, multiplayer games don't count! 10/10.

Your journey still continues with your fellow fighter where you later say goodbye to each other and you go by your own. In general, the game is vast, it offers many places and localities. It's not any short game, but other way around, pretty long game trick. For your hero, except inventory with weapons to his hands there is also an option of using a magic. Besides paths and brooks in the game, there are various mazes where you have to work with your mind. You'll have a little trouble with learning new spells or opening locks. Another special stuff are dragons. Pretty dangerous creatures,it's not very good to start an introduction with them. During the selection of race, you have a possibility to choose various entities. The view in the game will player choose on by himself. Purchase and sell of goods or weapons is possible in every town. A little defect of beauty are walk along mountanious terrain or if you have more load, things in inventory, you can't run then. Besides, graphics is created on high level. What about audio and messages  amazing. Processing of a game according to northern mythology was wonderful idea. Spectacular RPG game.

With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2. But you won't. You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you. If you start playing this game, you will become addicted. You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too. tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others.

These are all game play issues: 1) A FEW Players ratings. Messi is 20 everything as usual but he didn't have a great last season like he usualy does. Some players are quite underrated such as Di Maria and a few Atletico Madrid players. Ronaldo has 15 acceleration.... (not sure how that works.) 2) Some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainable.(not sure if it's a bug or not). Sometimes the defenders just heads/pass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it. 3) When players dribble they run into teamates far too often. Which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life. 4) This is a very irritating one. Players misses 1V1's far too much, if they have 4-5 '1V1' chances they'll manage to score one.... This is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply don't miss all those chances. You could say that they are having a bad game but it's happening consistantly throughout the season. Also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance. But our players just blast it strait at their keepers. 5) Final one so far... Players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable (sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target). So far I havn't seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition. Please could you fix these issues.

Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight. (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in. (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage. (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind. (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting. (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game. The Bad: Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO. (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.) (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.) Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO. Ack4orge Rating: 10/10 Perfect With the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market.","Sep 30, 2014, 4:30PM",0,"Sep 27, 2014, 8:26AM",0.8258064516129031,155,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0, 'num_achievements_attained': 167}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ack4orge,128,Ack4orge,22.0,27,1981.5,Ack4orge,0,Recommended,116.0,27,13,1,179,0.6663008621509369,0.64073116

After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve ""Guinsoo"" Feak. Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important ""authors""; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history. History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more! Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International. It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived. Oh, and it's sort of fun[/b] .","Feb 6, 2014, 7:39AM",0,"Feb 5, 2014, 4:13PM",0.8305084745762711,59,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery,49,thepastisbeyondrecovery,,10,1745.5,Vic,0,Recommended,,0,5,0,0,0.7417085181183444,0.746016

Let me tell you the story of when I started this game. You are only allowed to pick 1 of 3 starting classes, or warframes, out of the existing 10 or 15. So you play around and you want to make a weapon. You can either 1. use ingame points to unlock a blueprint for the weapon, if the weapon you want even has a blueprint, farm the resources to make the weapon which can take a really, really long time, especially for a starting player, after obtaining everything, spend even more ingame credits to START the making of the weapon which takes 24 hours (not joking), wait an entire day, and THEN you get to play with the weapon. Or 2. give Warframe your money. Making warframes is even worse. You have to fight the same boss over and over just hoping you get the right drops from it. You need a Chassis blueprint, systems blueprint, helmet blueprint, and a warframe blueprint. You need to build ALL those items before you can even begin making the warframe, which all use ingame credits AND TAKES 3 DAYS TO MAKE. Or you can throw your money at Warframe. Oh, and you can only have 2 warframes out of the 15 to play with. You only have 2 warframe slots and like 5 weapon slots. You want more weapons or warframes? Looks like you have to spend some MORE MONEY. You need to give Warframe more money so you can get more slots just to get more warframes and weapons. Let's talk gameplay. The gameplay is ""fun"". Sort of. I enjoyed playing solo missions more than playing with 3 other strangers . Why? Because if I play solo, I can try using stealth, which is impossible if your new ""teammates"" fly down the halls shooting everything in sight. Also, if I play solo, I can play at my own pace. Every single game that you play online with 4 people, the game becomes less of a fps and more of a race. Actually, that's a perfect description of what happens. It becomes less of ""There's 2 guys over there, I'll sneak up on one and shoot the other in the head"" and more of ""RUN RUN RUN OH LOOK AN ENEMY OH HES DEAD RUN FASTER FASTER"". It turns into a clusterf**k of color.... I'll summarize all of this. So basically, this is micro-transaction the game. The only way to enjoy the game to it's full extend is spending a lot of money. And I mean a lot. I would actually prefer it if you had to buy the game. That way, Warframe wouldn't be a lie, and you wouldn't have to deal with half the bullcrap in the game. Sadly, even IF they did that, you would have to deal with the OTHER half of the bullcrap, like waiting 3 days to play with a warframe. It's just a stupid system, and is just used to siphon more money from your wallet. Oh I forgot to mention, you can spend real money to speed up the process ._. so yea, more ways of spending money... great... The game is ""fun"" ish, if you can look passed all the crap, which I cannot. If you ignore the facts that you need to spend money to use more than 2 warframes, spend money to use more than 5 weapons, wait 3 days to use a new warframe, wait 24 hours to use a new weapon, how the game puts micro transaction after micro transaction in front of your face every single time you open the game (oh, if you stop playing for a day, the next time you open the game, you win a ""random reward"", which is ALWAYS a discount on your NEXT MICRO TRANSACTION), then you might like this game.

I'm gonna plug away and play this to the end someday, but even if you buy it now and aren't affected by the fact that the initial release contained maybe one fifth of the final content they slowly leaked out to users, there are still so many issues with this game that it's not really that fun to play. Yes it's realistic I suppose, if you don't count the fact that you can be shot in the face by a man with the vision of an eagle and the aim of a robot, who is so far away or hidden behind bushes that you can't even see him, but it's not fun to play. Consider the mines in the forest of the second level that you can't detect, and kill you, forcing a checkpoint restart and a frustrating trial-and-error progression through the area again and again. Consider the checkpoint about 5 minutes along from that one that is placed at the start of a 3 minute march, followed by a battle that, if you die during it, makes you start back at the beginning of the eventless 3 minute march. Consider these issues exacerbated by the manual save system that only lets you save at certain times, effectively dooming you to long endless stretches of replaying and replaying until you can slog through whatever ery they stick in front of you. Consider the poor optimisation that leaves the game chugging on a high-end pc, and still displaying all kinds of low-res textures anyway. Consider the frequent updates that corrupt your save files and render them unplayable. Consider the lack of a co-op campaign - one of the few things that made the buggy mess of ARMA II fun, and literally the only reason I bought this game in the first place. Perhaps I should have done my research, but then perhaps I had no idea what the total content of this game would contain when it bought it and was shocked to find it bare-bones, until they released the last of it months after I purchased it. In some ways it's a vast improvement over its predecessor - it looks much better, and the confusing and encyclopedic control system is explained MUCH better. The mission objectives are also a lot clearer, and completing a given mission isn't as much of a 'pray that you're in the wrong place rather than that the game as bugged out' scenario. But I still I don't know what Bohemia were attempting with this - so many design choices leave me tearing my hair out in frustration (why on earth would it take them months after release to add a tutorial section to the game? Should that not have been one of the first pieces of content released?). However, I suppose that most of my gripes regarding content have been resolved at this point, so at least that's a plus for those considering whether to buy, but all the odd little design quirks combine together to make playing this game a minefield in itself. One wrong move and you're ed.

I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more. I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE!

Unfortunately not anymore. Do you remember when Spongebob and Patrick went through the perfume department and nearly died. Well that is what Garry's Mod is like nowadays. As you try and move into this new world and explore the opportunities placed out there for you, you don't get sprayed with perfume like in the show, you get ambushed by the worst community ever, comprised of (Worst being first); Toddlers who are still learning how to speak (who either scream or cry into dollar tree mic's), Furries (That are just utterly terrible), FNAF Autists (who are autists), Bronies (Most of which take a game too seriously many others are down right annoying), and Anime nerds (A group that is neither good nor bad as there are some mature people within the group where the good ones are meh.. But the bad ones are BAD.) It is a rare occurance to find an actual nontard man/ woman (age 16+) who doesn't throw a fit over a game, drop a ban hammer if questioned, or has the ability to squeal so loud into a mic it breaks the sound barrier and sends the listeners off to the gates of hell to be annally massacred by the spirit of the Autist himself/herself until a new PewDiePie vid comes on of him screaming into his monitor while he watches Diners, Driveins, and Dives, where then you are given the chance to crawl on all 4s out of there and back to your home. Browsing the Workshop is also just like the perfume department. Every page is loaded with the exact same content for FNAF. Let me repeat that... Exact... Same... FNAF content. Often there will be some anime/brony/furry things but all together aren't as oftenly seen as FNAF autist stuff. Let it be known if you can make it through all of that cancer, there is a nice variety of content waiting for you. You will mostly see all of this stuff jammed into multiplayer like Cinema (loaded with the bad anime nerds), Jailbreak (loaded with autists in general) or Simon Says as i would like to call it becauase you know... Nothing says Jailbreak like Simon Says. It doesnt even make sense but for some odd reason the kids who run these servers find it enjoyable to just play simon says for hours upon hours in a jail ment to be broken out of. The rp servers are a joke. You are hit with the same community and you should expect to be kicked or banned a lot quicker than usual, and TTT which is loaded with coppies of the fat kid from sandlot who love to butter themselves up to the mods. Only few make it out in one piece, that being me. You think I always looked like this? This is the face a person who survived the impossible and made it out with all most of his brain cells or atleast enough to type this all up. Do yourself a favor and only get this game if you want to just sit in sandbox mode with a friend or two and make stuff for fun. But do not do what i did and go into multiplayer because you might not make it back out the same. Its funny, it really is, just to sit back and watch a bunch of kids yell incomprehensibly at eachother.","Apr 24, 2015, 1:51PM",0,"Apr 21, 2015, 6:45PM",0.6021505376344081,372,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.25, 'num_achievements_possible': 140, 'num_achievements_attained': 35}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071253139,224,76561198071253139,4.0,148,456.7,NicoDerm CQ,0,Not Recommended,30.0,106,69,6,47,0.7432797855054506,0.6795737

The game came with some issues for some people such as the username having special characters. However mine is my Microsoft Account with my email in there, it didn't seem to caused any issues in launching the game. I did have some issue launching it at start as I would click on the play button and it would show for couple second on Steam that I'm ""in-game"" but then it'd go away for no reason. The fix for that I found that you need to manually install the installers from ""Installers"" and ""_CommonRedist"" folder if you had an issue like mine where it didn't auto installed it. I am having another issue now the game crashing, it only crashed twice so far in my almost 2hr of game play but still is annoying. I am hoping for it to be working fine with couple updates. So once you're past that and can launch the game successfully. It's a gorgeous looking one to say the least in my opinion, PC port is better than Max Payne 3 for me. I'm playing it on 4K with 50-60 fps constantly in closed locaitons or while fighting and 45-50 while driving at everything max on 970 SLI setup. It's doing rather well and you'll get steady FPS with something like this setup. All in all .. the game is totally worth it's price, I didn't like these launch issues that I had which were minor but the game crashing and saying ""GTA V has stopped working"" is making me mad to say the least and others are still facing some other issues.

Because the program, which is known as ""Garry's Mod"" was stolen while it was still unfinished: Leading to the biggest problem in the program: It may randomly crash at any moment. The U.S secretely gave Garry amnesty for his crime in return for not telling VALVe that they had not reimbursed them for using the Source engine in the development of the project.

Some modders call others sell-outs for selling their mods, the sellers defend this by saying that all the hard work needs to be compensated for. THIS WAS A BAD IDEA!

It's a good game but at a terrible cost. No, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games. But truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside. Matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team. When it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying. If it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank. You are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often). If you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you. Maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust. The better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater. Where is the fun in all this, I ask?

As long as they keep pulling tricks like this, Football Manager is a series that will remain evergreen. But the biggest improvement to this game has got to be the match engine, Year after year were used to the buggy disappointing experience especially for us 3D users, But from what i've seen out of my first play, Currently 18 games into my season excluding friendles i haven't seen 1 bug, Maybe i'm lucky but for a beta that's impressive! It's much more fluid and all of the new animations that have been added has really added to the realism, The new interface has got to be the biggest plus aswell alot more cleaner kinda looks like a andriod tablet set up with the left hand bar down the side, And even when you're scrolling down you're squad list or scout list it feels alot more optimized.. The game has improved big time on processing speeds, I'm running the same size database with the same leagues as before, England, Scotland, Spain, Brazil, Portugal, MLS, France and Germany and the rest of the leagues on view only with a player base of 92,000 which doesn't struggle, Which was one of the down points of FM14 although it was fast there was sometimes you'd be going to you're browser while you were waiting, They've also added a new feature where you can choose you're licence and past playing experience which i found to be pretty amazing, Although i haven't fully understood it yet but i'll be sure to update this when i do, I haven't tried Classic Mode as of yet, But looking foward to having a go at it hopefully they've improved it this year with less clutter and more stats! All in all i have to give this game a 9/10 which is pretty damn impressive for a beta! One last thing.. We still have leaderboards, Was getting scared as i was seeing tons of ruhmours about it not being in this years version but they were proved wrong, Hopefully workshop comes back this year too.

To a master thief who isn't very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. All the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. Managing to build his own house and have a family. The main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you won't be bored for a long time. So don't just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. Out of the DLC's, the best would be Dragonborn. It offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. While the Dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and Hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. The worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. But only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest won't finish or continue. 8/10 Only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. You get stronger than all the enemies too quickly.

I think, I finally can say my own opinion. First of all, this game doesn't have an optimisation. Even though, you have a very powerful computer, it still will be lagging as  as it's possible. Secondly, VAC Anti-cheat doesn't work properly. There are many cheaters and what's very important, Valve doesn't give a ! In addition, the rank system in this game is totally unfair. You can be de-ranked for no reason. Also, there can be some people who have very low rank but they still can play like the global elite players( I don't mean about people who have the second account with low rank). Furthermore, the real community of this game consists of the ing idiots who cannot play well and they can only complain for some . As well as, annoying and pulling whole team down can be made by them. Unfortunately, it's really hard to find someone who can play well and without any doubt, show the real meaning of teamplay. By the way, about those things like the skins or something like this that don't make any sense. Valve is trying to get some money in the different ways. Especially, it's associated to the ing crates and keys. I completely don't recommend you to buy them, you'll actually lose money. In conclusion, this game definitely sucks and it can lead you to get a brain cancer. What's really funny that I will never stop playing this . Probably, I am already addicted. Here is a small advice for Valve: Valve, you are supposed to do something useful for this game that can really improve it.","Oct 16, 2014, 10:38PM",0,"Oct 15, 2014, 10:56PM",0.6666666666666661,18,"{'num_achievements_possible': 60, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.46666666666666606, 'num_achievements_attained': 28}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Kubix,12,-Kubix,46.0,6,1605.1,Kubix,0,Not Recommended,82.0,3355,2,1,416,0.727275611943892,0.72380215

The price is still pretty expensive and I would recommend buying it when it drops lower unless you can't wait to hijack a military jet or you are a hardcore GTA fan. I would also suggest playing this with a gamepad instead of a mouse except in some instances of shooting in moving vehicles. Ok, now time for the pros and cons: PROS - Good balance in gameplay time and character development between the 3 characters. - Graphics is very good and I would strongly recommend playing it at at least High settings, Try limiting the drop to Normal settings as it can really make a whole lot of difference. - Story is great and interesting except for a few loophole plots. Nonetheless, it really got my attention most of the time and future DLCs will definitely make it better - Voice acting is superb, I love the voice casts in this. They really suit their own characters, bravo R* - Director mode is pretty fun, its a PC exclusive and it enables the players to create their own settings (there are limitations though such as dialogues etc) and place characters that can be unlocked during story mode. I usually use it to wreck havoc in the game lol CONS - Online. As with many others, I find it hard to play an online mission without meeting someone who uses cheat. Sometimes, you will spend so much time looking for a party to play in and the missions ends in a blink of an eye. - Garage bug. Yup, I am one of the many victims who lost their heavily upgraded vehicles in their own garage after exiting the game. It doesn't happen all the time but you do get the fear of when this bug will strike next on your beloved cars All in all, this game is still great on its own. I would suggest GTA fans to get this.

One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CSs weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although its added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, its not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of 40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at 12, which I think is $15 in the US. Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and youre still alive you simply gain $0. The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game. http://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpg Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova youve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, its for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level. Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way ground breaking its been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace. I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you dont understand whats so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6u26YTpIF0 Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldnt play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when its on sale at 75% of! Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not. I would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review?
