Nevertheless the real problem is with the match engine: results like 3 to 5 or 4 to 4 are common, the goalkeeper stays on his line for every cross and the movements the players make in the engine are laughable.

I played for almost a thousand hours on the console version and I have clocked quite a lot on PC too. Modding made this game infinitley better. Modding is why i spent money on a game I had aldready beat on a different console. Modding is what made me decide to start playing on steam rather than a console. Modding is what is going to be the downfall of a once perfect game. Skyrim is one of my favorite games and it will always be, but the new paid mods feature is honestly nothing more than Valve trying to turn what was a hobby for people and something we all enjoyed for free into money making scheme under the ruse that it is for the modders' hard work. Nexus has a donate button, why couldn't they just make one for the workshop? Because this is not about the modders getting paid for something that is expected to be free. When the modders are making more money from their hard work instead of Valve, then maybe just maybe I will reconsider my thoughts, but until then I am going not reccomend this game to anyone who has not already purchased it (if there are any) and go get a buggy console version of the game because unless this policy changes, its only downhill from here.",,0,"Apr 25, 2015, 11:15AM",1.0,15,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.9466666666666661, 'num_achievements_possible': 75, 'num_achievements_attained': 71}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073707638,15,76561198073707638,5.0,0,254.2,hemorrhagic_shenanigans,0,Not Recommended,2.0,0,0,2,111

It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in. It starts off with a team trying to kill another team. I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun. Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course. When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more. CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically. Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness. In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports.

Being ranked as the third most-played game [steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we? First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain ""class"". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class. Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as ""rocket jumping"". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team. Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates. Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :) One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market! All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670 Highly Recommended Be sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","Feb 2, 2015, 4:21AM",1,"Oct 23, 2014, 8:20PM",0.9029688631426501,1381,"{'num_achievements_possible': 46, 'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0, 'num_achievements_attained': 46}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse,1247,nerdhouse,36.0,134,256.5,Nerd House,10,Recommended,229.0,66,30,118,1827

In the very beginning you have no idea who you are, where you are, or why youre aboard a carriage filled with condemned prisoners. All you know is youre an outsider, and once youve reached your destination, your execution awaits. The caravan arrives in the small forted village of Helgan, where youre pulled from the carriage. Your captors fail to recognize you; theyre just as puzzled by your appearance as anyone else. Are you a man or woman, an Argonian or Breton? This is your first opportunity to ask yourself who you are and who you want to be in Skyrim; it wont be the last time you ask yourself this. Lucky for you, the execution fails, granting you an opportunity to escape Helgan. This is where Skyrim commences and where your story within Bethesdas world begins. Youve been told to visit a town not far north of your escape, but nothing other than the word of your new friend is there to compel you to visit it. The entire province is at your fingertips. Skyrim is structured in a loose manner, allowing the player to discover its world and various narrative strands at the pace that they desire. Characters will tell you where you should go, but there is never any real urgency to do any of it. The world is cluttered with distractions and what makes this experience unique is the distractions form the very heart of Skyrim. The core narrative, as it is, is a mean to an end, an excuse to pilot you from one corner of the world to the other. Its hard to imagine anyone following a single narrative strand when its impossible to travel from one quest point to the next without stumbling upon some sort of ruin, cave, encampment or fort. The narrative has its high points, but its always made secondary by the next undiscovered location on your compass; and thats because Bethesda wants you to pave your own story. Undiscovered locations dot the entire province of Skyrim, leaving the map a venerable piece of swiss cheese after a few dozen hours. Discoveries are the actual loot and tracking every single one of them down is the addiction that thrusts players headfirst into Bethesdas fiction. Every location, small or large, is populated with its own personal story, which makes every journey feel special and rewarding. Theres an understanding that this world, this place, existed before you fell upon it; theres also an unshakable feeling that its all been staged for you. Skyrim would have you believe its a dynamic world thats constantly in flux, when in reality its more like a car stuck in neutral, waiting to be put into gear. Characters go about their daily routines but they merely exist to bestow quests or impart dense records of lore; no-one is truly alive when youre not engaged with them. One of the principal quest lines revolves around the Imperials and the Stormcloaks, two factions waging a purportedly bloody, savage civil war that has split the region in two. In each and every town across the land nearly every single person is happy to share an opinion on the war, telling you how dire the situation has become. But there is no war, no conflict, not unless you decide to take part in it yourself; you may see hundreds of random encounters in this Nordic land, but youll never see the War for Skyrim unfolding. Fiction aside, Skyrim is a vast, majestic world to discover. Bethesda is unparalleled when it comes to world building and when youre wading through brooks, scaling mountains or eviscerating another cave full of bandits its an absolute joy. Its a remarkable, liberating feeling that this province was crafted specifically for you; a huge playground with apparently no rules or boundaries. That isnt the case. Skyrim has its rules; theyre specific and they have a nasty way of reminding you this fiction was written in binary. Every city subscribes to a simple bounty system: commit a crime and youll be struck down, pay a fine, or spend the night in jail. There is a clear consequence to crime, but its merely an illusion. On my first evening in the town of Morthal I snuck into the Jarls house and then into the private quarters of her daughter, where I then attempted to pickpocket the young sleeping woman. Without the deftest of hands, the girl arose, alerting the guards of my treachery. Not wanting a fight or untimely death, I submitted, volunteering to pay my bounty and spend the evening locked up. The following morning, strolling from my cell, I bumped into the sleeping girl once more: she asked me to deliver a letter of utmost importance for her; she trusted me. The bounty system is a dirty way to gloss over any real consequence for your actions. There is no gray area; everyone is either a friend or foe. When an enemy is nearly defeated they may beg for mercy, pleading with you to spare them. You can sheath your weapon but they will never flee, every single one will get up and rush you. Once, a villager followed me into a vampires hideout, hoping to avenge the death of his wife. Madness erupted and amid the scuffle I inadvertently grazed him with a fire spell, turning him immediately against me (note: the vampires who killed his wife were still very much alive). Afterward, instead of arriving to a town full of indebted villagers, I returned to an armed welcome and an outstanding bounty. There was no way to explain how the town learned of my accidental deed and no way to silence the vengeful widower  I tried killing him several times. Once youve found the parameters that Skyrim works with, its not difficult to play by its rules, and even enjoy it. There is a huge, jaw dropping world to discover at whatever pace you desire. Along the way youre free to author your own story, defining your unique character and experience through whatever style of play you prefer. When youre lost in its rich landscape and enthralled within its fiction, Skyrim thrives, and is truly unparalleled; its when you take a closer look, you cant help but discover the seams holding this tapestry together.

The realism makes this the most exciting and action-packed pc game I've ever played. The majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides, then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself. How did the game know I have Parkinson's? You'll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field, and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute. It's almost like playing tag with good friends, except for the part where someone gets tagged. I did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by, and I'm sure the AI experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another. Ironically, when well- hidden behind a tree or rock (or other random cover) and peek around the corner, the AI suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot. That'll teach me for trying to be tactical. Save points are set within the game, and waypoints are even more predictable, leading to non-frustrating replays and non-existent monotony. There's no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the AI has Xray and auto-aim, so that's a relief. Your squad will most likely make all the kills, and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you. Also, certain characters have infinite health so there's no real urgency in helping with firefights. Time to kick back and let everyone else have fun. Then there's the weird controls, which will have you rolling on the floor (literally) out of cover right into incoming fire. That's the last thing the enemy expects! You'll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers, only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface. I guess that's my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute. As a plus, you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier. I forgot to mention that you'll bleed out and die if you don't bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body. That's actually pretty realistic, since it's a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health. As you're wounded, aim and mobility decrease to the point that's so real you won't be able to contribute in any positive way, except to be cannon fodder for the enemy. It's ok though, when you die you'll get to respawn with full health. But then when you restart the checkpoint, you can't fire your gun because there's apparently a glitch in programming (or is it?) which doesn't allow reloading. This is great, since the game already saved your progress and you're stuck with one bullet you can't fire anyways. The realism is scary. I would not recommend this game for $60, or even on sale for $30. I would wait till the price increases to at least $99.99, so that way you'll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game that's so realistic, you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience. Just make sure you're terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete. Sorry, not illusion; simulation.","Oct 25, 2014, 10:00PM",0,"Oct 25, 2014, 9:56PM",0.515384615384615,130,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054967253,67,76561198054967253,,63,4.6,Chitsujo,0,Not Recommended,,0,9,0,0

So, like any other true christian would I decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path, but when I loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings.

Then our world was sh*t upon by the powers that be; Gaben and Icefraud, both nigh on untouchable behind their shroud of lies and broken promises. We queued, ready for the action, the thrill, the skill, to survive and thrive in a high skilled scenario we'd spent over a thousand hours training for. This, this was our moment. We chose our heroes, heroes we have always enjoyed playing, heroes that happen to be OP this patch. Our spirits were higher than Snoop Dogg in a forest fire. We hit 'Play'. I entered the game... Josh did not. My brother-in-arms had fallen, nay, been tripped at the first hurdle! Gaben would simply not allow him access. His dota would restart and he'd spam the play button again and again but to no avail. This sordid process went on for 5 minutes. 5 minutes I will never forget. The worst 5 minutes of my life. Eventually Josh gave up, uninstalled and played Poker Night. And in that moment I remembered the hundreds of pounds I have poured into Valve. The armory of virtual hats I have treasured and loathed in the pursuit of cosmetic gratification. And a great rage swelled within me. A rage that threatened to burst upon volvo customer support in a dire tide of expletives and jokes about HL3.

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale.

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

There are always glitches, bugs, and issues that accrue the ire of many players, but DE (the company behind Warframe) is next to always on top of releasing patches. Warframe, in a brief nutshell, is a space-age, sci-fi ninja hack-and-slash with an intriguing storyline (the ""prequel"" to Warframe is Dark Sector) where the Tenno - the race every player is - has been pushed back into the Void, and has only recently come back to find the Sol System in the middle of a three-way war between the militaristic and brutish Grineer, the greedy and technological Corpus, and the overwhelming numbers of the Infested. The Tenno's role in this game is to bring balance back to the Sol System by assassinating key personell from all sides who threaten galactic stability. Gameplay-wise, Warframe is - at the time of this review - very ""grind-y"", such as other MMORPGs. To level up, one has to fight the enemy, collect resources (a drop from enemies or by releasing a Titan Extractor to systems), collect modifications (a drop from enemies) and clear planetary systems (usually by defeating the boss). Weapons are unlocked via purchasing blueprints and crafting them with one's gained resources, and one must also have the appropriate ""mastery rank"" (on paper, your overall player level separate from weapon levels, Warframe levels, and sentinel levels), which is leveled up by leveling up Warframes and weapons. Weapon-wise, combat feels visceral and satisfying, for the most part. Some weapons have become outdated while some have begun to shine. The Warframe you control determines how fast, how well-armored, and what powers the players has, with a general rule that caster-classes have low shields, health, and armor, but possess potent powers, and fighter-classes have high health, shields, and armor, but have less powerful abilities than casters. There IS a real-world currency market in place, but 99% of the items sold there can be made/found by playing the game itself. The 1% of items not found are purely cosmetic, such as color schemes and syndanas (capes). The real-world currency to game currency ratio, in this author's opinion, is quite unbalanced, however. 75 platinum (the game currency) is $5 USD, with bonus platinum being awarded depending on how much one purchases in one transaction (for example, 180 platinum is gained from $10 USD; 150 being from the $10, and a 30 platinum bonus). Warframe is able to be played alone, but is much more enjoyable and beneficial with friends or a clan. With a moderate amount of startup resources, one can start their own clan, or can simply join a preexisting clan to save resources. Clans offer clanmates to join games with a player, clan technology (which offers high-end weaponry), and miscellaneous activities, such as 1 v 1 PvP in a dueling arena, trading, and obstacle courses. Finally, Warframe has a dedicated forums page to report bugs, meet with potential clan members, introduce yourself, make suggestions, offer feedback, or generally just shoot the breeze with fellow players. PROS: +Multiplayer with clanmates or friends is enjoyable and practical +Everything save for cosmetics can be obtained without real money +Solid swordplay, gunplay, and Warframe powers +Complex damage system which promotes a well-coordinated squad and a variety in weapons +Many side activities +Many graphics settings can be changed, so lower-end PC users don't have to worry as much +Forums have a decent, active community CONS: -Prone to glitches and bugs after major updates, but are rectified quickly -Playing solo can be tough at higher levels and bosses -Real currency to game currency is at an uneven ratio -Damage system can take some time to learn and master -Grinding for resources can be a bore at times","Dec 11, 2013, 10:26AM",0,"Dec 5, 2013, 11:54AM",0.622222222222222,45,"{'num_achievements_attained': 8, 'num_achievements_possible': 33, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.24242424242424201}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066264095,28,76561198066264095,21.0,17,1092.6,John the Cynic,1,Recommended,27.0,28,5,4,126

It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in. It starts off with a team trying to kill another team. I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun. Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course. When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more. CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically. Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness. In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).","Jan 13, 2014, 1:45AM",0,"Jan 13, 2014, 1:35AM",0.9123711340206181,388,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_attained': 129, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.772455089820359}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealToTheTenThousandthDegree,354,RealToTheTenThousandthDegree,7.0,34,6059.1,ManaF,0,Recommended,270.0,3,22,1,19

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... ""Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds."" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most ""mature"" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a ""pay-to-win game"" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.","Jul 7, 2015, 5:00PM",3,"May 7, 2015, 4:18PM",0.9252548131370321,883,"{'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.5, 'num_achievements_attained': 44}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi,817,emperorgandhi,17.0,66,941.2,[CotC] King Conga Gandhi,3,Recommended,269.0,1278,29,42,123

The developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game. They keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom Real Virtuality engine rather than replacing it, as well as adding new campaigns, missions, vehicles, weapons, and game modes. The part where this game REALLY shines, however, is the community driven mods. The game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make ANYTHING they want out of this game. It may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page, but I've seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims, ""grand theft auto"" like games (Arma Life), hardcore zombie games (DayZ), a StarGate tribute which had working, animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show, ww2 sims (Invasion 1944), Jurassic Park tributes, and so much more. These mods take a lot of work to create, sure, but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing. Simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down. Now add some waypoints for them to attack a town. Add some soldiers inside the town. That's it! If you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers, using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy. This all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on. Want to do more? Read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it you'll have the ability to make suicide bombers, ""battle busses"" (essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it), nuclear bombs, and really ANYTHING you can imagine. If you have any issues, someone will be willing to help you out either on reddit.com/r/armadev or on the official Bohemia Interactive forums. I hope you'll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or I just freshly made in the editor! Even if you don't like making your own content, there are fun mods already out there such as the popular Battle Royale mod where you're forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear. Just look around and you'll find endless entertainment in this game! THE BAD --------------- I mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced. This does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games, but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs. Another warning I would give would-be buyers is that the game is very demanding for your PC. People who have rigs that they THINK are powerful because they can play Battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise: Arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware. At the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples' hardware, even when pretty impressive, just doesn't get along with the game that well at the moment.","Jun 23, 2014, 12:27PM",0,"Jun 23, 2014, 11:58AM",0.846153846153846,26,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/trenchninja,22,trenchninja,,4,487.2,TrenchNinja,0,Recommended,,0,1,0,0

Its a basic Cops vs. Robbers but the objective for the terrioists is to plant a bomb in a certain bombsite while avoiding or killing the counter-terroists. There is also another game type where the terrioists take some hostages and the counter-terrioists must resuce the hostage and return them to the hostage zone. There is 5 different modes excluding community servers. There is Deathmatch, where u spawn randomly on a certain map and u can choose any weapon u want, in my opinion its a great way for the beginners to get started in CS:GO. Next is Arms Race which is similar to Deathmatch but u get a new gun every time u get a kill and when u got a kill with every gun, u have to kill someone with a knife which is kinda hard. Another type is Demolition which u get a new gun every kill u get but u must wait until the next round, if u get more than 1 kill, u are awarded with grenades. Casual is known as the most played mode which is technically the `actual` game which u must use the money u earn from kills and rounds to buy guns. Finally the most important one, Competetive where it is a 5v5 game however unlike Casual where u can see the enemy on the map and even watch them, u cannot see where ur enemy is unless u hear footsteps or gunshots. It is important u co-operate with ur teammates if u wanna win cause thats the most important thing in CS:GO, teamwork. As of now, there have been hackers who aim hack and shoot through walls when u cant do that normally. Many people have reported this but Valve has done nothing about it but make updates for their guns when they clearly know theres hackers and thousands of people hate it. I would give this game 10 out of 10 but since there is hackers and smurfs who pay another 15 or 7 bucks just to kill newcomers when its not fair, i give this game 7 out of 10. The reason being is hackers and smurfs take 2 away and the servers take 1 away.

They have started to roll out the campaign, finally after a few months after realese. What helped Arma II was the modding scene and even just the mission files for multiplayer which will further improve the life of this game, as this seems to be the direction that Arma III is going and that for one thing is excellent. This could spur some very interesting gameplay and I am hoping it would catch on with groups such as ShacTac or LSG just like in Arma II. Graphicly the game has improved alot from its predecessor, implimenting modern lighting and just looking far superior which may not matter for most people but it is a nice addition for the game. Now for the downfall. Not everyone has this but many people do. The game has severe problems with performance and not knowing how to utilise CPU and GPU properly. (http://i.imgur.com/pkwvj34h.jpg http://i.imgur.com/RQog0QF.jpg) These two screenshots show the utilisation of the game and it is quite clearly awful. Playing the game at 10-25 FPS is not possible. You are at hinderance when playing with this sort of preformance. The BiS developers seem like they are trying to avoid this problem, moving threads to less noticable places is one of the ways basically just outright trying to get rid of the people complaining. This feels like bad practice for the company acting this way towards their paying customers. When it comes to problems such as this they seem to respond very badly. A similar problem a while ago caused them to reply and they said it is ""too hard and we are not willing"" (SOURCE:http://steamcommunity.com/app/107410/discussions/0/864961722019263834/ ). Really I do not think they should be developing games if things are going to be to hard for them. They are letting down customers and it is a real big shame because this game is really promising. Finally PROS: Excellent Multi-Roll Military Sim Beautiful Graphics IMO Way Smoother than Arma II ex. shooting,aiming Altis and Stratis being very versitile and can make for interesting gameplay Improved physics with bullets and vehicles The ragdolls! CONS: Severe performance issues and utilisation The sound assets could be better (That is nothing mods cannot sort) Game feels incomplete having only a select few vehicles/weapons The campaign only just being rolled out again feeling incomplete Thanks for reading! **Edit So, I upgraded my PC and have been playing a feck ton of Arma recently. The sad thing is though my FPS never stays above 60fps and I still sometimes even drop below 30fps with such a good PC. It is really, really depressing that this game is so awfully optimised. When I jumping in the editor and Get 60+fps I see what the game could be. They have also now finished the campaign and on the plus side JSRS studios are developing a new version of JSRS. That is going to be a must have mod in Arma III for me. I am still going to leave this unrecommended on the fact that it does not even seem to have changed despite spending alot of money on a new PC and even buying a watercooler for the CPU so I could overclock it, just to find out that I still get bad FPS. I am playing the game yes. I am also enjoying the game but underlying all of that is still disappointment. I guess if you like Arma II and you think your PC would be up to it, go for it. Otherwise don't bother. Again, thanks for reading!","Dec 17, 2014, 11:53AM",0,"Nov 27, 2013, 12:38PM",0.559822747415066,677,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.042857142857142004, 'num_achievements_attained': 3, 'num_achievements_possible': 70}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElkoMM,379,ElkoMM,14.0,298,366.9,Dmitriy,0,Not Recommended,82.0,67,69,2,104

Personally, the best feeling I had while playing this game was getting back to my home, after 3 days of fighting dragons, exploring dungeons and talking with NPCs. My kids were eager to see what I got them, so I gave them a lot of toys I have found in the huge landscape. They also had surprises waiting for me, plenty alchemical ingredients, and even coins. There are many races to choose from, my favorite one being the Khajit, a cat-human appearance specialised in Sneaking and Thieving. Players who don't like this playing style, but generally want to play as a Khajit (or any other race) will be happy to see that Skyrim lets them make the character THEY want. If you want, for example, a Mage Argonian, it will be, of course, harder work than for a High Elf, but as much rewarding, because you will notice how your character truly evolves during the adventure. You have tons of options, tons of playing styles (which you can mix or even change at any point in the game if you feel like it). But enough with characters. Other aspect which really felt unique and incredible was the size of the land. Not only Skyrim itself is huge, considerably one of the biggest maps seen in a video game, but it's also fullfilled with things to do. I never went from one hold to another without finding plenty of puzzles, chests, dungeons into my way. And, if you're like me, you don't want to rush through the main story and prefer instead to explore more or do miscellaneous quests, you'll be glad to take the side roads whenever you see them. They will take you to caves, mines, villages, farms, dungeons, and even dragon lairs. The exploration never had an end for me, not even after so many hours spent into the game. You are probably curious about the combat system. While technically not one of the best I have seen in a RPG, I must admit that it had massively been improved since Morrowind and Oblivion. The ''Luck'' factor is not present any more, so you can't miss a shot when you clearly were very close to the enemy. The third person combat camera is now immersive, with tons of new animations and a new feature which I like a lot: the killcam. One final aspect I'd like to talk about is the length of the game. While the main storyline is relatively short (took me around 10 hours on hardest difficulty), the side quests and guild quests make this game incredibly long. If you get Skyrim and plan on beating every single quest, clearing every dungeon, finding every landmark, you'd better get prepared for a very, VERY long journey. I myself haven't completed a quarter of the entire game yet (checked progress with a mod). This game is by far my favorite RPG at the time being, its biggest rival in my opinion being Dragon Age: Inquisition. Pros: + incredibly large landscape, mixing bioms from tundra to winter, from pine forest to stone holds; + a lot of locations, free for player to explore; hundreds of dungeons, caves, which at their turn are themselves long and filled with enemies, puzzles, traps which will reward handsomely the player at the end; + plenty of quests, most of which don't require the player to have completed the main questline; + the introduction of dragons as enemies, for the first time in the Elder Scrolls games; + residents of cities and villages all have their own lives and families. In the morning, they will leave their home and go to their job, in the afternoon they will take a break for eating, and in the evening they will close their shop and go back to their home or at the inn for some mead, where after a few hours will go to sleep; + random encounters will let the player find more about the game; fugitives will tell you to keep their stolen item for a short while, followed by a scene where the owner finds you and asks you whether you have seen the thief (at this point, you can lie, you can tell him where the thief went, or you can be most honest and give him his item); couriers will once in a while give the corespondence to you, which can lead to impressive new quests or will update your map with new locations; you can find farmers giving their cows as sacrifice for the giants, and many, many more other events, all unpredicatble; + the leveling system has been improved since Oblivion: after you have a high level, you will no longer see ALL enemies wearing the Daedric armor, instead you will continue to find packs of bandits, some of them having leather armor and others having more powerful armor and items; + player can buy home in 5 holds, where he can place his loot, take his wife and kids and take a rest; this, personally, felt like a huge immersive feature in the game world; + new powers added to the game world, called Shouts; will let you find out more about it x); + you feel that your character truly evolves as you progress; more over, you can make what you want of your character: a good warrior, archer, thief, mage etc., by using perks; Cons: - interface is worse than at previous games; you can't sort items by criterias (feature that had been available in Oblivion), you can't search for a specific item when you have plenty of loot in your backpack, and the aspect is generally bad; thus i recommend using a mod that changes inventory; - while reasonable, the game is filled with bugs, some of which can even break a quest; again, i recommend using the Unofficial Patches; - some textures and meshes haven't been vigurously worked by developers and they look bad for 2011; Personal rating: 95/100",,0,"Apr 28, 2015, 6:41AM",0.881355932203389,59,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.11363636363636301, 'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_attained': 10}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/asteo600,52,asteo600,43.0,7,829.6,Asteo600,0,Recommended,371.0,2235,2,15,186

I wrote something for real! These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think!

They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds."" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most ""mature"" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a ""pay-to-win game"" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.","Jul 7, 2015, 5:00PM",3,"May 7, 2015, 4:18PM",0.9258849557522121,904,"{'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.625, 'num_achievements_attained': 55}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi,837,emperorgandhi,17.0,67,944.1,[CotC] King Conga Gandhi,3,Recommended,270.0,1278,30,42,123

Gameplay-wise, Warframe is actually a great game, but the really messed up RNG ruins the hard work that the gameplay has done. It's so random in fact, that I've encountered several scenarios wherein energy orbs are either a dime a dozen, or harder to find than Waldo in a Carmen Sandiego book (now apply this to loot, enemies, currency, and crafting materials). That being said, it isn't lost to me that the developers did this intentionally, just so that it would be easier to entice players to use actual money to buy the in-game currency (platinum), or the other ""pay to win"" options available (buy warframes, weapons, boosts, and materials as opposed to farming them). Got a lot of money to bypass the crappy RNG? Play this game. Got a lot of time to waste on the crappy RNG? Play this game. No money or time? GTFO and avoid this like the plague. EDIT: If you want to play this game, but also want to reduce the wild RNG's relevance, then I suggest that you keep logging in till you get the 75% discount to Platinum, then buy the 4300 Platinum pack from the store for 50USD. That much platinum is more than enough to get you started and then some, and the value is great.","Apr 3, 2015, 6:48PM",0,"Mar 28, 2015, 9:51AM",0.566037735849056,53,"{'num_achievements_attained': 104, 'num_achievements_possible': 132, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.7878787878787871}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008476695,30,76561198008476695,8.0,23,341.5,Tim,0,Not Recommended,12.0,5,5,4,18

Spent a lot of time working on training regimens to make sure the historically injury prone have slightly less intense work outs. Spent hours working my scouts to death... Got near the start of the season and had some great transfers lined up to come in. Wanyama, Tielemans, Depay, and a few other youngins. A net spend sure but after negotiating hard deals for Kaboul, Capoue, and Adebayor I was well within the transfer budget. We are go for launch! A few days after the deals were agreed but before the players came to terms, what happens? Kaboul our 4 weeks. Capoue broken for 3 months. In training. The deals are off and I have not saved for hours. I swear to god, they made injuries a problem so you have to buy the editor. I'll need to see STELLAR reviews for any future version before I pay again. What an absolute heartbreaking shame. There used to be a game here. Update: 1-24-2015 I still don't recommend this game. I DO recommend this series. Nothing else compares to FM. There isn't a single sports management simulation in all of video games that comes close to how well FM does what it idoes. If you are a new player, get FM14. It'll be cheaper, and you don't have to pay full price for FM15 to get up to date rosters. Search the community hub and google for player and team updates and how to install them. Again, if you are on the fence, GET FM14. It's super good. Original Review: I've averaged about 650-700 hours in each years FM, dating back to 2011. I'll keep this short. There are great improvements to this game, I just wish I could get to them. Every game I start, no matter the team, no matter the training, no matter the facilities, within 2 months of day one half of my first team is injured. This game is seriously broken right now. If there are not major fixes, I can consider my FM addiction cured.","Mar 18, 2015, 6:09PM",0,"Nov 14, 2014, 4:25AM",0.777777777777777,63,"{'num_achievements_attained': 192, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.37065637065637, 'num_achievements_possible': 518}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Panzerschreck,49,Panzerschreck,11.0,14,91.5,Panzer[CFH],0,Not Recommended,64.0,0,0,2,126

The high score lines and players getting injured every game is very unrealistic and not up to usual standard. I've been playing FM since the start and was put off by the mix reviews on here but decided to try it for myself . I dont understand how people can honestly enjoy or reccommend this game in its current state? Pros- Looks good and performance is fast. New interface is good and easy to use once you get used to it. Scouting has been improved. Cons- Far too many injuries ,at least one per game leading to a selection crisis. No matter what team or league I pick. Far too many high score lines, 4-4, 6-4, 7-5 , 4-3 , even against lower league teams. Goal keepers are slow to get up after a save. Defending is poor/non existent no matter what team or tactics you deploy , I have yet to keep a clean sheet. Far too many goals from long range against you. Far too many goals conceded from crosses. One game with Everton vs New England Revelation I had 30 shots on target and scored 2 goals. They had 6 and they beat me 6-2! Its not very realistic and what I expect from a Football manager game . I can put up with the high scorelines, but the constant injuries is infuriating. No matter what team or league or the set up in training etc , even the reserves seem to pick up injuries . You shouldnt have a selection headache due to injury a few games into the season. It has potential but Im only a few hours in and these issues have put me off. I expected to be lost in the game and have 20 plus hours gameplay by now!

May take some time to fix it -- campaign saves may be corrupted after an update - takes time to learn the basics - desync on multiplayer (which is a server/player issue, no Arma 3 issue) - vehicle physics/collisions (Hunter can move HEMTT etc.) ?? Karts DLC Gameplay Arma 3 is a tactical military/war/combat simulation. You control a soldier on 2 huge maps: Stratis and Altis. Once you get used to the keybindings (there are a lot!) there's nothing that can stop you. If you prefer slow and realistic combat over fast FPSs (such as CS, CoD or BF) it's definitely worth checking out. Arma 3 does not offer a ranking system (some servers do) and you need to check your surroundings before you start shooting someone. Otherwise you'll end up unconscious in the middle of nowhere. Scenarios - Single Player Main Campaign: Arma 3 offers a great campaign with an interesting story line. You're playing as NATO soldier Cpl Kerry. The main campaign is split into 3 chapters/episodes: ""Survive"", ""Adapt"" and ""Win"". In the first chapter you need to survive in a multi-force conflict on Stratis. It's a quite instructive Episode, showing you the Arma 3 101s, such as moving, diving, driving, shooting etc. There's no pop-up message showing you what to do, but usually you can open a ""Help"" tab by pressing H. The missions on Survive are quite controlled, but if you keep hiding behind a rock your Squad Members will have a hard time or even die. So if you don't want to be left alone, you should do what you're supposed to. The second Episode plays on Altis, where you join a local Guerilla force. In this chapter you learn how to control your own squad and how the communication system works. You still have your orders, but you can leave the base and explore the map whenever you want, playing optional missions or looking for better weapons. Finally, in ""Win"" you join the NATO reinforcment. In this chapter you need to show what you've learned so far, fighting a lot of enemies ;-) Scenarios - Workshop / SP / COOP The Steam Workshop offers a lot of user created content, which you should definitely check out. Many of them can be played in coop with friends or even on servers. There are some stock Arma 3 coop missions you can play as well. Scenarios - Multiplayer There are a lot of Servers online, which offer a lot of different scenarios and modifications. I'll cover just a few (popular) of them: Domination: Basically ""King of the Hill"" where you need to capture cities. Usually you can use whatever gear you want and choose your function (Engineer, Medic, Commander, ...). Every function has its own abilities, which you can benefit from. Most servers also support side missions, where you can get new vehicles, choppers or jets. Domination's my personal favourite. Wasteland: It's a team deathmatch mode where you can join multiple groups or play on your own. You usually start with a pistol and need to find/buy weapons and supplies (water, food, ..) to survive. If you earned enough money you can build your personal fort. There are vehicles and choppers on the map, but most of them are broken and you need to repair/refuel them. But you can also get special vehicles for your team by doing side missions which appear every few minutes. Certainly, the other teams try to do the same thing. Altis Life: One of the most popular game modes. It's basically a ""cops and robbers""/""roleplay"" simulation. There are police forces which are other players controlling the cities. As long as you don't do anything illegal, such as killing someone or carry weed with you, they won't do anything to you. It's a fun mode if you want to play Arma without shooting someone all the time. Microphone is recommended! Scenarios - Do it yourself! You certainly can host your own server. There are a lot of scenarios which you can download and modify. Arma 3 also offers you an Editor which you can use to build your own scenario from scratch. It's quite hard if you don't know anything about scripting or never used the Arma editor before, but there are a lot of tutorials on youtube and on forums which you can check out. Kart DLC There's not much I can tell about the DLC, but you can drive Karts, Yay! Known issues A lot of people are not able to play Arma 3 on a stable framerate, despite their superior machine. If you have any performance issues, check out the online tutorials on how to fix it. There are a lot of possible ways to increase your performance. But worth the money? Imho, definitely! It's been over a year and the devs still add content. Check out videos on youtube or try the game on free weekends if you're interested but don't know if it's something for you.

There are things wrong with the match engine as others have pointed out, but the whole series has emphasised width over depth since it moved from being CM to FM - I've been playing since Domark versions on the Amiga. I remember when we only had text based commentary and the tension was incredible, there was the feeling of just being given enough information and let your imagination fill in the gaps. FM2015 in particular gives you so many features it can initially feel overwhelming, until that is, you realise it doesn't really matter. Keep your players happy, make sure your tactics are reasonably sane, gradually improve your squad, and well that's it... Obviously, you can complicate that as much as you like if that's what you want, but the whole game experience is totally flat now. Every iteration just adds a couple more features that aren't really fleshed out much on top of a bunch of features from previous iterations that haven't been developed further once they have been introduced. All we seem to really pay 40 (assuming you buy on release) for is a data update and a quick polish - it makes no difference if the dev team have put thousands of hours into each version if the end-users experience is so stale - it's lost sight of the end-user experience, and that's what hurts so much. The adding of in-game purchases is also a massive turn-off for me (and others who have given up on FM sooner than I inevitably will); seriously, micro-payment to increase your club's bank balance?

This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[2] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[3] Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]","May 5, 2014, 2:32PM",0,"May 5, 2014, 2:30PM",0.818181818181818,11,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.754491017964071, 'num_achievements_attained': 126}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/regularbag,9,regularbag,6.0,2,516.1,Bag +HDHRDTFL,0,Recommended,36.0,6,1,2,8

Ok now about review : Grand Theft Auto V is a spectacular third person free roaming game which does well in portraying everyone's guilty pleasures, whether that is slaughtering innocents, exploding cop cars with RPGs, murdering hookers or taking a trip to the local strip club. Grand Theft Auto has always been amongst the greatest free-roam shooters of all time, and it continues that legacy here with GTA V. The online experience and racing have been greatly improved and the story features three playable protagonists rather than the traditional one. In the story of Grand Theft Auto V, you play as three very different characters, with three different, distinctive personalities. First is Michael, a retiree from the illegitimate business of bank robbing and a family man with tons of family problems. Next is the young blood, Franklin. Straight outta the hood and looking to make a living without having to look over his shoulder every step of the way. Lastly is Trevor, the truly psychotic man with no regards for human life. Everyone that plays GTA V instinctively chooses a favorite character, whether it is Michael, because you want to see him get his family back on track, Franklin, because you want to see him create a future for himself, or Trevor, because you too enjoy killing drunken rednecks. Regardless you must play as all three, and the greatest feature that separates the campaign of Grand Theft Auto V from all others is the bank heists. Plan and execute heists, whether you choose stealthy or an all out blood bath, choose your crew which ultimately decides the payout you receive from each heist and enjoy every detail and heist you can. The story is well worth the price of buying the game, but it comes with an added bonus. GTA Online. Although GTA Online had a rocky start with several issues, it is for the most part fixed today, and a very fun experience to play with friends. In the beginning their were terrible servers, problems involving created characters being deleted and now the mission payouts being much lower than early release, and replaying them pays out even less. Along with most others, I am still awaiting for heists in multiplayer, which very well may never come, but regardless GTA Online is still fun. You still have the ability to run around and kill others, as well as civilians, but instead of that simplicity, you can now customize your character, his vehicles, and even where he lives. You earn money through online missions and other methods that helps you pay for newer vehicles, apartments, weapons and clothes. You create your own character and literally choose his skills, which you can later improve. Grand Theft Auto always has great replay value, gamers still play San Andreas and GTA IV, and of course, several thousand still play GTA V. After the story is over, you can always free roam, and when you get tired of wandering aimlessly, the multiplayer is great to play for long periods of time. Gain satisfaction improving your vehicles and purchasing a high end apartment. I only have one little note about this game, NOT FOR KIDS. Seriously, if you are even the least bit immature, or offended by violence, language or sexual content, please do not buy this game, and don't buy it for kids either. A great game but it's worth waiting for, especially if it will traumatize you, or turn you from innocent, into a kid that spews foul language. Overall a masterpiece.

You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available. The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. Youll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, youll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team. Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that youll be teamed up with wont always show the same willingness to communicate. If youre just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique. Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if youre playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldnt prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, dont worry.

Trust me!* Alexander the Great (Greece) reviews the components needed to make the Spaceship. He notices that he needs the engine, but doesn't have the proper technology to obtain this piece for a Scientific victory. Angered at this, he asks his remaining friends for some research agreements to get the tech he needs to win. He gets two from his friends, Ramkhamhaeng (Did I spell that right? Anyway, Siam) and also Pedro II (Brazil) but it wouldn't go into effect for about 30 turns. Alex just groans and begins to switch up his productions and his science so he can aim toward getting that engine. Oda Nobunaga (Japan) then begins to take down Ramesses II's (Egypt) last city, which was his capital. Siam gets angered by seeing that Oda is taking down all of their allies, and attempts to charge at him. Japan was able to sweep his army and destroyed all of his cities with his deadly ability where wounded units still fight at full strength. Pedro II sends a Spy to Oda's capital to see where he will strike next: Him or Alex. Alex and Pedro set up some defenses and attempt to build a wall to defend themself from this unstoppable force. Oda decides to hit Pedro first, and slowly takes down all of his cities, one by one, and took down Rio de Janeiro. The Greek forces began to hold the enemy Marines and Paratroopers off. After a successful ambush by an XCOM Unit, Alexander had some time to finish up the engine technology. The next turn, Sparta and all of the other cities besides Athens were destroyed by Oda's unstoppable force. However, right when Oda was about to charge in and destroy Greece, both Research Agreements were used and got the technology needed. Alex quickly moved all his units away from Athens and used his remaining gold to purchase the engine. It was pricey, but he was able to attach it to the Spaceship. Japanese units were closing in fast, and the Greek soldiers started dying quickly, but right when the artillery was about to fire, they all see the glorius sight of a spaceship flying in the sky and going to space. Oda looks at the spaceship and starts yelling in defeat, knowing that he lost to Greece with a Scientific victory, right when they were about to get a Domination victory. In Civilization V, or Civ, those events are actually pretty common. It takes a little while to get used to, but once you get into it, it becomes very addictive to the point you haven't slept in days.

That says something. I definitely recommend playing TF2 or at least trying it out. However, I believe that to fully enjoy this game, you cannot play for a short period of time. My reason for this belief is that when I first started playing TF2, I played for around an hour and didn't really like it. However, I decided to try playing again around a month after my first try, and I slowly began to enjoy it. Over time, I began to understand how to play as each of the characters, and unlocked many game-changing items. TF2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, it's like entering a whole new world. TF2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game.","Jul 15, 2015, 4:09PM",9,"Jul 11, 2014, 7:31PM",0.7450980392156861,51,"{'num_achievements_possible': 13, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.07692307692307601, 'num_achievements_attained': 1}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheese9898,38,Cheese9898,48.0,13,312.4,cheese.9898,2,Recommended,220.0,316,2,15,371

Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business.

Before I hear some smarmy child tell me what I should do, or what i did wrong, here is a list of  I have already done: -verified the integrity of the cache, -updated my graphics drivers, -updated visual C redist, -updated directX, -launched the game as administrator, -launched their rockstar social club BS launcher as administrator, -DELETED their rockstar social club launcher and verified AGAIN, -updated my graphics drivers to the BETA drivers, -VERIFIED THE INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE -updated WINDOWS -tried some dubious ini files which MIGHT fix this POS game, or might give me a virus... -disabled GPU and run intel only* -disable windows firewall because WHY NOT!??* DID I MENTION I VERIFIED THE INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE??? oh yeah and I posted a ticket to Rockster support and have received NO response, as well as received no response (ranging to snarky unhelpful responses) from the steam forums...* *UPDATE* i DID hear from rockstar support about a day and a half after i posted the ticket (and after i called them out on Twitter) and here is a list of things they have told me to do which has ALSO not worked: -can you effing believe they told me to verify the integrity of the cache? i'm dead serious -send them a launcher.log file which doesn't exist, located in a folder which doesn't exist -disable my firewall, or switch firewalls (really?) -open an executable they sent me, probably the biggest ray of hope i had was when they sent me the EXE, which were very quickly dashed when i opened it and i gave me a ""sorry, Grand Theft Auto is not installed on this machine, please reinstall."" message I can most assuredly say, without a doubt, that GTA V is installed on my machine. BUT HEY AT LEAST ROCKSTAR PATCHED OUT MOD SUPPORT! ""but wait, if you can't even open the game, how is you have 5 minutes of play?"" from repeatedly opening it, and watching it crash, I generated the 5 minutes of play required to write this review. WHY? because I am that  off, i am that mad, after all the nonsense i heard about Rockstar doing a good port of this game, from different new sites, from different users, from different reviews, the game just DOESN'T WORK. maybe it's something real easy, something real simple, but if that's the case, then that represents how much Rockster screwed up. people need to know, YOU need to know, before you buy this game, that there is a chance that it just may not work, regardless of your machine, and regardless of what you do, the game is still broken. I may amend this review if Rockstar fixes the problem, but honestly i don't know how good the game would have to be to undo the amount of BS i've been put through.

ARMA 3's ""future-istic"" setting doesn't make sense, and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd. While I appreciate the new vehicles such as the MRAP ""Hunter"" or the newly updated ""Ghosthawk"" (Blackhawk), or any of that sort of updated feel. I'm not saying change is a bad thing, I'm just saying sometimes too much change isn't. A great addition to the ARMA series, was the much requested ""stances"" available to you during the game. Whether it's leaning from standing, crouching, or even laying on your side in the prone position, it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks, windows, and walls that you're either too short or too tall for. There are 3 standing stances, 3 crouching stances, a sitting position, and a prone position. Every stance except for sitting, allows you to step out to the side, or lean around cover. From the prone, you can peak a corner, or lay on your side. This vastly improves over ARMA 2's restricted movement. It would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls, or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well, but that's just wishful thinking. Another thing I noticed, is the sound of the weapons. A lot of the weapons have similar sounds, which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle you're getting into. While some of the sounds such as explosions, vehicles, and other small ambient additions are nice, I feel like I'm often confused and lost with the sounds. Hopefully, a good soundmod will fix this later down the road. AI. . . AI. . .AI. . . One thing the ARMA series hasn't been able to nail down, is the AI's movement, pathing, communication, and skills. I realize that it's really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this, where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective, or how, but often you'll either find your allies falling behind, running out of formation for a second, or asking ""Where are you"" after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves. It would be nice to see AI being able to figure out things based on other AI, and not almost strictly from you. Combat awareness. Something I noticed in ARMA, is that no matter what situation, the AI in combat are lacking, whether an enemy soldier, or a friendly, you'll notice them not finding cover, running into the middle of a street, or from behind cover out into the open. On one of my first ""showcase"" missions, I was instructed by my AI squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover. ""Neat"" I thought. He then gave me an area to suppress, as I was an automatic rifleman. I began laying fire down from my position, my own squad leader walked next to me, and as he gave an order, ran right in front of me, bushing me back, and causing a bullet to hit him in the head, resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing. Note, the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second, leaving me no time to react. Their aim isn't that great either. You could be standing across a room and they won't be able to hit you, or they'll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies of-guard yet, not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it. Now, this goes both ways. To combat them being ""too easy"", you could set the dificulty to Expert of Veteran. The problem with this, is that the change is too extreme. Setting your game to the highest difficulty, results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily. You could be concealed at night in a bush, and taking you out. That, or you'll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley. My advice? Find some friends or a group to join, disable AI teammates for the mission, and only play with a team made up of human players, 9 times out of 10, you'll be able to accurately cover teammates, move together in a more realistic and effective way, and it will increase your expierence 10-fold. Here's an example of the Helo AI in this game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203646487 Another weird problem you may notice, is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer. You may or many not have issues, and to top it off, it's really sporatic and without a known cause. In singleplayer however, this is not the case, and the game runs a lot smoother. and it is quite confusing, and frustrating when trying to set your settings. Here's an example. You go to singleplayer, and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering. The game looks great, and you're real happy with it. Now your friend hops on, or you want to go play on a server. You select one with the best player/ping ratio, and join it. You notice right away your frames are a lot worse, and you sit the tinkering with your settings again, mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game. Not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game, but when you join back to singleplayer, the game looks worse, and you either have to deal with the settings again, or get stuck with lower graphics. Now, changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either, so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration. Overall: If you're a fan of the ARMA series, or any realistic shooter, I'd go for ARMA 3. While I still play ARMA 2 more, ARMA 3 offers enough change when I get tired of the former. Improved graphics and lighting, vehicle handling, weapon handling, and the use of different combat ""stances"", really improves over ARMA 2's static and prohibited movement. While you won't be in the deserts of Takistan, or going through the dense city of Zargabad, the Islands of Stratis and Altis, are sure to give you the variety and fun you'd want. While the AI isn't improved much, some of the futuristic units, and factions don't fit well, and the sounds can tend to be confusing, ARMA 3 is definitely a step in the right direction, and a giant leap towards success.","Mar 17, 2014, 3:35PM",9,"Jan 5, 2014, 2:44PM",0.816793893129771,131,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.5172413793103441, 'num_achievements_attained': 15, 'num_achievements_possible': 29}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Prototype5566,107,Prototype5566,27.0,24,875.4,Dejection,1,Recommended,335.0,1511,8,7,199

(This is the case for almost everyone who has windows 8/10 as you usually have the ""@"" due to the Microsoft account). 2. More launcher issues - Beside this there are various problems for people with different AVs, Dual graphic card settings, etc. 3. Performance - It is a hit and miss. Once you finally can get into it..It works... Next time it is so slow it does crash windows as it has an massive issue with memory spill. It is playable, yes. Some people do get lucky and have a machine where it does work..and the game itself is as good as you have seen it on the consoles a year ago. But...Some if not most players experience problems....

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally, though, you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and ""tryhardish."" Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't ""hate free."" I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more ""tryhard."" Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the ""this is ranked, you better be a damn good player"" mentality. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself and that's why I keep going back to it. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things, it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being ""OP"") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero ""pay to win"" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. To put it roughly in perspective: Playing Dota 2 is like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a ""fooping idiot"" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? ""Uninstall Skyrim, noob."" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? ""Learn to play, tard."" It would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures, would it not? Sadly that's how Dota 2's community is. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine), which is 50% of the time (and sometimes not even when you're winning). It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. Often your day will just be worse after playing Dota 2, instead of it cheering you up as games do. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're good to go. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting ""a stick in the mud"" player on your team. Great game with bad community.","Feb 14, 2015, 6:00AM",0,"Nov 14, 2014, 6:42PM",0.7941693892937921,3979,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.6000000000000001, 'num_achievements_possible': 75, 'num_achievements_attained': 45}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001352969,3160,76561198001352969,22.0,819,2651.1,Clash of Rivia,0,Not Recommended,8.0,5,260,2,99

""CS:GO is love,"" he says, ""CS:GO is life."" His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, ""Try your chances... Open a case."" Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

The game itself is great, I love the new features, graphics, characters, etc. However, there are so many bugs and problems it makes playing impossible. The first most annoying problem is the crashing. At startup, the game crashes after looping the intro sound for about 5 minutes. Only after that can you play by pressing the retry button. Second, the game is very, very, very laggy. After playing about 10 minutes of smooth as silk gameplay, the game fluctuates from high fps to 0, in many stutters. It is not my pc or anything because the game is very smooth with inconsistent, frequent stutters, not a rough constant fps. This makes playing unbearable, even low fps would be preferred. Lastly, a few minor bugs are that in the voice settings menu, if you go down to it, the game automatically freezes and crashes. UPDATE: For some reason, I played today and got dream results. No crashing for the first time ever when opening, and it did not stutter once, even after leaving the game for some time.

This game have Great Graphics , but with only graphics you can't make a good game. So this game have a great choice of Weapons , but 70% of them feels the same and more than half of them are not very useful with high-level enemies. And this game have a lot of Enemies , but all of them feels the same and doing the same tactics, nearly only things that change with them are weapon, models and protection types (flesh, cloned flesh, robotic or ferrite armor, etc.), all enemies dies the same in your daily slaughter. Edit: But, they adding new Mini-boss type enemies, such as: Grineer Manics, Corpus Bursa and Infested Juggernaut Diversity of Tilesets , and they all beatiful and atmospheric, but it doesn't really profitable to play on 60% of tilesets. because some of them (Dark Sectors have bigger Resource Chance and more XP and Orokin Void which have Prime Parts and more XP for example) are more profitable. Archwing , it's nice to fly in open space and shot\melee every enemy who flies near you, but right now it's just barebones, nothing more interesting in it than few Extermination, Sabotages and Interception Missions and all of the Archwing and their specific weapons are locked behind a grind. Kubrow , you can got and rise your own dog-like loyal companion, but they are just running everywhere and dying and then they losts their loyality which you can refill only by 30% per day (they losts it like 20% per their dead), and their health drops about 10% per day, you need to buy refills (DNA Stabilizers, 6 things per 75,000 credits) which refill only 40% per use. and to find a egg you need to spend about 2-200 runs (depends of random and your luck) to get one. so in point of view they are just credit-sink and any normal sentinel can replace every type of doge (and sentinels don't require credits to take care of them and don't lose loyalty after death) This game have great variety of Warframes and their awesome abilities, and most of them have many differences in abilities and different stats (and cool looks) This game have a nice amount of Bosses (one boss per planet), but most of them are bulletspongy and boring, for example you need to wait until they become vulnerable or you need to shot into specific hit-point to kill them (example: Councilor Vay Hek, General Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, or Mutalist Alad V) and some of them closed behind grind for keys to get frame which drops from them ( Vay Hek(Hydroid) (No longer needs a key), Lephantis(Nekros), Mutalist Alad V(Mesa)) In this game you can get every weapon\frame without paying platinum (in-game currency you need to buy with real-life money (but still you can get it through in-game trade with people)), but you need to grind for them (blueprint costs credits (in-game currency you get through doing missions) some blueprints requires research from Clan Dojo 's laboratories, which requires credits and resources too, and blueprints requires resources and credits to craft them (Resources you can get through missions from killing enemies). Cool variety of Mods for Warframes and Weapons, which drops from enemies and you can make you weapon\frame more powerfull with them, but some mods are rare and some mods drops from rare enemies, and some mods are very, very close to be useless (Intruder: +6 seconds for hacking Maxed, Rifle Aptitude: +15% status chance Maxed.) But even so this game is very good, and i had a good fun with it, i'm recommending it, try to play it with friends and kill things together. Developers support this game with Weekly Updates and Hotfixes in which they fixing bugs, glitches and adding some new changes or items 9.5/10, this game still grows and becomes more interesting with time, i hope on this game's release developers will get rid of all disadvantages in it.

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... ""Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds."" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most ""mature"" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a ""pay-to-win game"" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.","Jul 7, 2015, 5:00PM",3,"May 7, 2015, 4:18PM",0.924657534246575,876,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.598455598455598, 'num_achievements_attained': 310}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi,810,emperorgandhi,17.0,66,938.9,[CotC] King Conga Gandhi,3,Recommended,268.0,1278,29,42,123

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale.

I guess im wrong. So i started my game, the last coach had ended his career with 5 wins streak. So i felt pressured to win in the begin. Won 2 matches were my team was expected to tie. So far So good. Then i started noticing it. Next match starts. Everythings fine. My Defender is about to get the ball... Know what happens? He sundenly slows down and nearly stops walking, enemy striker gets the ball and scores. I tough it was a isolated mistake of the match engine so i continued. Next match my striker was running foward, grabbed the ball, man on man vs the keeper, he stops running and 4 defenders reach him. He can easily score from there. Does he shot? No. He tries to dribble the 4 defenders by going in the MIDDLE of them. Later i saw my striker running, he had no chance to get the ball, enemy defender did the wost pass i ever saw and fell into the ground for no real reason then started crying. My striker had a chance in front of the goal man on man. He kicks the ball slow and near the keeper and... its in?! Might be a bug. Thats when you start noticing every corner kick that is going to ANY PLAYER BUT A STRIKER near the first post will go in. Works for both sides. My Defender did a hat trick with those corners, striker had even more opportunities by the same way and didnt kick the ball. Enemy also scored like this, between my defenders leg that is. Im not opening this game again until january update,i swear to god. SI should release FM at january instead of releasing it at november every year with the match engine sloppier and sloppier.

Personally I find no use in firewall, it does nothing but slow me down, and I keep my computer clean, physically and digitally, so for me, I have no use what so ever for firewall and it is always disabled. Still everytime I run into an issue while playing (which I must say, happens literally once or twice an hour) and report it to the support team, they always tell me the same thing, ""Allow the system to run through firewall."" but when I exclaim to them that this cannot be the problem I am met with an apology and instructions on how to allow a program through firewall.

This game is amazing! If you want to know why then keep reading. DOTA 2 is a completely free to play MOBA. The things that you can buy are mostly just for novelty or cosmetics for your heroes. There's no paying to win in this game. If you are interested in winning expect to put a lot of time in as this game has a STEEP learning curve. The good news is that this game is so popular that you won't have any trouble finding some game guides or youtube videos to help you out. Dota 2 is also one of the best Esports games out there currently. They have tournaments on a regular basis and you are able to watch them directly from in game! This game also has fantastic graphics and can run easily on most PCs. On top of that the game is developed by Valve so of course it has fantastic support both from them and the community. This without a doubt is one of the best games available today. Did I mention it was free?

This tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product The changes made this year have largely been pleasing, although in particular I am not a fan of the new tactics board. It seems like the information I need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks, generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to FM14. The gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series. The engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others, again mirroring previous versions of the game. There seem to be more goals going in, more goals from crosses and set pieces, and more defensive errors. The game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly. I only use the 2D Classic view so cant comment on the 3D match engine, I have never used it or had any interest in it. Fundamentally, its still great fun to build and develop a team, to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat.

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases. Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired. On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now. We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community. I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for). Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.",,0,"Nov 21, 2014, 12:18PM",0.953472222222222,4320,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/weeabooshogun,4119,weeabooshogun,,201,345.9,Weeaboo Shogun,0,Recommended,,0,164,0,0

Skyrim, the game that many of us love dearly, the game that many of us love to mod, is now being plagued by so called paid mods. Paid mods are fine, but the concept and execution are uber poor by Valve and Bethesda. I would list them all, but it's gonna be a hella long review, so I'll just list the most important ones. 1. Copyright issues. Money-driven motivation will definitely come into play. And it's dirty, dirty motivation. 2. Assets stealing. It speaks for itself. 3. No quality assurance, so poor quality paid mods will emerge as I write this. 4. Bethesda no longer give us patch for Skyrim, despite so many bugs existing in this latest version. With paid mods they'll just reap money and do nothing. Unacceptable. Do your job, Bethesda, and do it properly. Not to mention unfair treatment for modders. Yes, taking royalties for base game's existence is fine, taking royalties for Steam's cut is fine, but 25% for modders is a downright ripoff. I am against this so much. At least give the content creators an ability to put up donation links straight to their own pockets, and also let pay what you want feature to be exactly what pay you want, starting from 0.00001 USD.

Yes I may only have 8 hours into this game but that doesn't mean I can not give my opinion. Community -I bought this game on a whim, I heard from everybody about how good it is so I decided to give it a try. My first game I had to listen to some guy yell at me because I did not know what I was doing. I quickly just brushed it off and went to another lobby after the game. I encountered the same exact thing. The community complains about how outsiders look at the game and that is because the community drives them away. Don't get me wrong, there is the occasional nice guy/girl that will help new people but they are few and far between. Do not even get me started on the cash grab that they call crates and weapon skins. Gameplay - The game has a steep learning curve which I enjoyed at first. But then the errors of the game became a little more clear. There were obvious hitbox issues when I played, which of course people will say is due to skill, and the shot registration just felt sub par for a game held on such a high pedestal. Gamemodes - The gamemodes are simplistic and easy to grasp onto. It took me a round or two to understand the objective. I have no complaints about the gamemodes/ Price - Yes I understand thast this game was just $15 but you can not defend a game just because you didn't pay full price. That is like if somebody goes out to eat and they have a gift card, and then all of the sudden the food isn't as good as they usually make it because he is paying less. There is no justifiable reason. Verdict - I gave this game a chance, I would say that 8 hours is plenty long enough to come up with an opinion. I never go home and think to myself ""Lets go play some Counter Strike."" If I do play it is because my friends pester me about it. I can see where people can enjoy the game but it is just not the game for me.",,0,"Jan 18, 2015, 1:35PM",0.7894736842105261,19,"{'num_achievements_possible': 29, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.275862068965517, 'num_achievements_attained': 8}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116116788,15,76561198116116788,21.0,4,329.9,Dee Snutz,0,Not Recommended,38.0,49,2,1,126

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale.

Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competetive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your freinds or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" againt players who purchased a secondary account and posess the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competetive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, becuse you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These higly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smufrs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practially forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!) -----Update 1------ Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :D Good luck and (try to) have fun! ----Update 2----- Thanks for all the responses everyone! The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :D I actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days. One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor. For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back.

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... ""Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds."" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most ""mature"" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a ""pay-to-win game"" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.","Jul 7, 2015, 5:00PM",3,"May 7, 2015, 4:18PM",0.9258849557522121,904,"{'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.625, 'num_achievements_attained': 55}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi,837,emperorgandhi,17.0,67,944.1,[CotC] King Conga Gandhi,3,Recommended,270.0,1278,30,42,123

After playing a lot of TF2, I bought CS:GO and it was a relatively smooth transition for me due to my TF2 experience. CS:GO easily became my favorite game to play. I originally got ranked at silver 4, and started my climb from there. Over the course of roughly a year, I've made plenty of friends, and learned a lot about the game. I'll separate this into two groups below: The actual game: CS:GO is a game that, for me, bridges the gap between a competitive game and a game I can play all day just to have fun. With CS:GO's matchmaking, it is quite easy to get into a 5v5 competitive game with people of equal skill as you. Matchmaking is a great way to start playing competitive CS:GO, but it is not ideal if you want to improve. If you want to take CS:GO more seriously, you have to use 3rd party services such as FaceIT, CEVO, or ESEA where you will face players that have a higher skill level than in matchmaking(not really FaceIT, FaceIT is the ""entry-level"" service, at least in North America, so it has a lot of newer players). Unfortunately, Valve's matchmaking system is flawed and has smurfs in low ranks and hackers in high ranks, so most people that want to improve or play seriously tend to use 3rd party services. Also, CS:GO has community servers just like any other source game. These community servers run different mods and feature special community-made gamemodes such as KZ, bhop, minigames, retakes, awp only, scoutzknives, and many others. These various gamemeodes supply me with hours of casual fun with my friends when I just feel like relaxing. Trading/skins: Trading has effected CS:GO both positively and negatively. With the addition of weapon skins into the game, CS:GO grew rapidly. CS:GO trading brought a lot of TF2 traders over to CS:GO and started an ingame economy similar to TF2. Also, skin betting on csgolounge was added. Betting skins on professional matches lets you put skins on your favorite teams to cheer them on to victory. The thing is that many people take betting way too seriously(death threats to players, ddosing matches, etc etc). Csgolounge betting has had way more negative impacts on the game than positive in my opinion. I personally try to stay away from trading because it is honestly too stressful for me, and I have no patience. That's all I have to say about CS:GO right now. I would recommend CS:GO to everybody that plays any type of shooter game. A mere $15 has given me nearly 2000 hours of enjoyment, and it will continue to supply more fun for me for a long time.","Apr 12, 2015, 10:07AM",0,"Apr 12, 2015, 10:05AM",0.9111111111111111,45,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.9041916167664671, 'num_achievements_attained': 151}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/5927,41,5927,20.0,4,2151.4,knife,0,Recommended,37.0,34,11,2,45

Unfortunately, every patch (and there's about 4/week) makes the game even worse. It's been out for almost a year, and I don't think a single bug has ever been addressed, while every patch brings a whole host of new bugs; most minor, some major. The netcode is terrible. There are no dedicated servers, instead relying on one of the four players to host. It seeks out the absolute worst host imagineable for every game. When I play with friends it's fine, but about 9/10 times you play with the public the lag is so bad as to render the game as unplayable. The game frequently refuses to accept certain inputs. It's fairly common to just be plain unable to use your melee weapon, or be unable to crouch for several games. Bosses occasionally become completely invincible. Did I mention the lag? It's bad. I don't just mean there's lots of snap back, and targets become impossible to hit; I'm talking extended intervals (i.e. double-digit minutes) where it's so bad you have trouble leaving the room you're currently in. The variety of weapons started out as neat, unfortunately they've increased the grind factor needed to get them every day. This is the rare case of a an early Beta game being pretty fantastic, but absolutely every change they've made since then has been for the worse. I would pay money for the Warframe of 8 months ago.

This game will be fun for you, if you dont know how to spend your free time or if you dont have other videogames. Otherways, you will end after 30 hours. From my personal experience, If you have a good imagination, then you will forget what real life is. I remember, how I got this game for christmas before 3 years. Well, I did not have much friends or other hobbies, so I started to play it. I imagined my self-created stories with my characters, like: my elf character is cursed bad guy and etc. Then I met my girfriend, so I had to say ""goodbye"" to skyrim. I think If I did not have her, I could have over 1000 hours on it. But now seriously, that was my personal though, now lets say something more about the game, shall we ? + 6 main campaings: Dragonborn (not much plot-twists, but thats what the game is all about.) Companions (Mercenaries, few plot-twist, sympatic characters in it. Aela is hot by the way) Mage University(I dont like to play as mage, so I didnt like it much, but it is worth it) Thieves Guild( I liked that one, contains really rememberable characters, many plot twists, AWESOME) The Dark Brotherhood(Assassins, I though being murderer wont be job for me in skyrim. But damn, this campaing made me play the game many times. It has sympatic characters and unforgetable plot twists. With the Thieves Guild, this was the best one for me) And the last one - Empire vs. Stormcloak Rebelion (civil war. Both sideshave truth in something, but only the Stormcloak Leader is sympatic) +DLCs include Dragonborn - New whole island, new campaing and about 25 hours of doing everything there. Dawnguard - Two new factions - Vampires vs. Vampire Hunters. Sympatic Girl Serana. And Crossbows. Hearthfire - ""The Sims DLC"" - you can build 3 houses, adopt children -Game was released with many bugs, which doesnt bother me so much,but physics in specific parts of this game cant be forgiven. - I DONT LIKE, when someone says that Skyrim is the best RPG game of all the time. There are better RPGs like the Witcher, Gothic etc. Skyrim is one of the better ones, but not the best one. Do I recommend you to buy it ? Of course I do ! 9/10 But... I regret that time wasted on this game. If I spent my time better, than... I dont know... I maybe had more friends than I have now. Who knows. So dont be like me. Dont be no-life kids as I was.

It was the first game I had ever bought on Steam, and around that time in fall of 2008 there were only three characters updated with achievement weapons. Trading and hats weren't in existence yet, and the game truly was a ""teamwork required"" type of game. Every class felt balanced and fair, with each one having their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Even the achievement weapons brought a nice change of pace from the normal minigun and bonesaw. You actually felt accomplished when you did the achievements because you were rewarded. The community was surprisingly welcoming, and a majority of my Steam friends came from TF2. At the time, we had thought that Valve was going to update the rest of the characters with their own achievements and that would be all; and for awhile, we were right. One by one the rest of the classes got their own weapons and achievements, and by July 8th 2010 (Happy Birthday to me!), the Engineer was the last character updated. The game felt complete, three years in the making. Now... I think everyone knows what's coming next. Before I get into detail on the update that changed (or in my opinion, ruined) everything, let me just say that Valve had already put hats into the game months before, way back in August 2009. I was perfectly fine with the hats, they added a sense of personality to your classes and all you had to do in order to get them was play the game (a novel concept, I know). Hats were the only thing given to you as a random drop back then. I should probably point out that I took about a year break away from gaming at this point in time due to ""real life."" While I was away, the Mann-Conomy update happened. This update wasn't like any of the others, this update added tons of brand new weapons and hats, along with the addition of an in-game store and trading system to get them. When I eventually returned to TF2, the game wasn't about the objectives, or teamwork, or even being the best player anymore. All the game was about now was collecting the most hats and weapons you could get your hands on. The achievements didn't matter anymore because you could just buy whatever you wanted, or just find it as a random drop (since they updated it to more than just hats). The game that I fell in love with, spending sleepless nights for years, was all for nothing at the drop of a hat (quite literally). I'm not mad at Valve for what they did, from a business standpoint this is the smartest thing they've ever done. But whenever I see the game in my Steam library, I just get a deep feeling of nostalgia and longing for something that could have been. I hope that one day, I'll be able to relive those fond memories I have with Team Fortress 2.","Sep 6, 2014, 4:51PM",0,"Sep 6, 2014, 10:05AM",0.589977220956719,439,"{'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/KHFan20,259,KHFan20,21.0,180,636.8,KHFan20,0,Not Recommended,39.0,334,33,11,167

TLDR: FM15 has improvements over FM13 and FM14, but feels like two steps forward and one step back. Veterans of the series will see that some of their main concerns have still not been addressed while other unwanted/unnecessary changes were made. My rating: 3 out of 5 A more detailed review can be found below. Long Version Pros: More dialogue choices for meetings/players ; these conversations have more benefit than previous games (and stuff like tunnel interviews). Assistants also seem to give better advice about addressing your team than previous games too. Ability to individually train players. You can choose what positions, what playing styles/habits they learn, and what individual stats you want them to focus on. Transfers seem a bit more realistic , especially when a club does not want to sell a player. Same goes for staffing transfers. My only complaint is when it comes to trying to recruit quality youth players and the clubs want 40m+ for them. I mean, I get it, but no 15 year old kid would realistically be bought for 40m euros Adding benefits to transfers/contracts seem to properly influence negotiations. Weekly/monthly payments, bonuses, even buyout clauses all seem to effect the overall bartering. More players (youth in particular) with potential, but less become actual all-stars. After the first season or two, a lot of my focus goes to developing youth players with potential. Id say out of the eight who were 4  to 5 start potential, only three of them wound up at 4+ star ability. Neutral: The interface is much simpler and easier to navigate (excluding the Tactics menu) but takes some getting used to. It feels less intuitive at first, especially for those familiar with the normal UI, but eventually becomes easy to navigate. The match engine is kind-of improved , but many of the same problems (40 shots vs 1 shot and you lose 0-1, that kind of stuff) are still ever present. 3d engine has occasional glitches during highlights but never anything game breaking. Cons: There is STILL a ridiculous amount of injuries. This was one of the problems I complained about most during the beta, and while it does seem to be toned down a bit, its still a huge issue. I understand that injuries happen in real life, but this is far too much. A good example: I was playing a season with Dortmund and had a 10 day international break. During that time four of my starters were all injured, three of them IN THE SAME GAME (and were all on the same team). Theyve fixed most of the buggy UI, but I personally like to play the game in Windowed mode and split screen with a live game or a movie or something. Many of the UI elements dont seem to account for this and either render incorrectly or reverse preferences / settings every time you change the screen. Searching for players/staff doesn't always yield proper results. Even if you enable the large database and whatever leagues you are interested, Ive still struggled to find some players or staff that actually exist in my game when trying to use the name search in the scouting field. If I go to the club and look for the player however, I can usually find them. I touched on this a bit under neutral, but I feel like some points are worth reiterating about the match engine considering the game is based around it. The game struggles with the same tactic fits them all logic like most of the previous generations have, and there is definitely the same amount of shoddy logic (like players missing open net shots, injuries occurring when no contact is actually made, and much more). Conclusion If you are a veteran of the series, I personally think the biggest hurdle will be learning the new UI. The game hasnt really made any massive improvements over FM14 and it seems like the devs neglected to address some of the main complaints from the past. Between this and the constant injuries that plagued the game , I found myself constantly making backup saves just in case five of my players come back from an international break with an injury. Overall I'm fairly happy with FM15. Granted the majority of people purchase these games just for the updated clubs and all that, but the game has a lot of potential as always. I'm personally a bigger fan of FMC than I am the more ""traditional"" FM, but they both have been improved on overall. It's definitely a step in the right direction though. If you've played Football Manager before and didn't enjoy it, this one isn't going to make you love it any more than the past ones.

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale.

Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)","Sep 30, 2014, 12:43PM",0,"Sep 30, 2014, 8:55AM",0.9570477918935271,1653,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.28846153846153805, 'num_achievements_attained': 15, 'num_achievements_possible': 52}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDanius,1582,TheDanius,31.0,71,731.4,[13th] Danius,0,Recommended,193.0,371,51,12,62

Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.","Jul 20, 2014, 10:33AM",0,"Mar 4, 2014, 9:24PM",0.8757602085143351,1151,"{'num_achievements_attained': 118, 'num_achievements_possible': 132, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.893939393939393}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatorplayspacman,1008,Predatorplayspacman,12.0,143,3289.3,Brovahkiin,0,Recommended,63.0,44,47,7,126

Being ranked as the third most-played game [steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we? First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain ""class"". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class. Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as ""rocket jumping"". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team. Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates. Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :) One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market! All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670 Highly Recommended Be sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","Feb 2, 2015, 4:21AM",1,"Oct 23, 2014, 8:20PM",0.9029688631426501,1381,"{'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.5340909090909091, 'num_achievements_attained': 47}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse,1247,nerdhouse,36.0,134,256.5,Nerd House,10,Recommended,143.0,66,30,118,1827

The game is getting better (especially with the Marksman DLC - Deployable bipods and weapon resting make combat so much better) - but my previous comment stands. I can not justify to anyone who has not played it before at this price. This is a game to pick up on a steam sale & its DLC. My recommendation - do not purchase it until then, unless you are desperately in need of this game. EDIT2: As fair warning - I will be deleting posts that personally attack anyone. This is for talking about ArmA3, not how stupid people are. I will delete your post if it is just an emotional response. Thank you. After 1752 hours of gameplay, 3 created mods, and thousands of written code, I can safely say that ArmA 3 is an incomplete game in its vanilla state. I am speaking from a standpoint of someone who has been with the ArmA series for a long time. I expected more from ArmA 3 and I am dissapointed by its current state. The Bohemia team is fantastic at post-launch support and I am glad to see that they are still loving this baby. There are several things that still dissapoint me about the ArmA series that I was hoping to have improved in ArmA 3. When ArmA clicks, it is an amazing experience that you can NOT get anywhere else. However, this does not mean I am blind to its downfalls - and what I was hoping to see improved upon in this series. 1)Confusing/Complicated interactions Now. I am not saying you can't learn these over time. ArmA has a difficult learning curve that is a little unncessary. The interface is just awful. ""Want to look through your rifle scope? Click the right mouse button. No. Click it. Dont hold it. That makes your view zoom in and youll hold your breath. Oh, damn. Did you control-click earlier? Yup. That swapped your scope to the little red dot sight on top. Right click to get back to the regular view. Now you can control-click to move the view youll bring up from the dot sight to the scope. Yes, I know theres no way for you to know what view youll bring up before you right click."" - http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/09/25/arma-iii-pushes-boundaries-combined-arms-warfare-patience/ 2) AI performance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRfhW-g7-zs The AI are almost brain dead at times. I don't expect anything near perfection - but why do AI have to have hack shotting skills to present a challenge? AI still lack basic abilities to effectively communicate and move properly. The AI also are way more costly on CPU then they need to be - While looking at the AI's code ( I can post pictures if you'd like ) a good chunk of their FSM's have been deactivated for quite some time. When is this going to be fixed? In a recent patch, Bohemia added AI supression. IN A RECENT PATCH. This is ArmA 3. A Military Simulator. Where suppression did not exist until recently. Even with supression AI will only look for cover if it is in within 10 meters. Otherwise they will just lay down in an open field and either 1) Shoot you directly in the face or 2) Wait to die. AI do not work well in teams and do not coordinate well in combined arms situations. APCs/helicopters/infantry can look cool when they work together but it is usually a scripted event or a random chance event. (AI will not call artillery to help them, helicopters will spot enemies but not report it to friendly AI so they can be aware of an ambush, and etc) The AI is the bare minimum and leaves more to be desired. =================================== I could only recommend this game if it was ~25-30 dollars. The game is missing a lot of promised features - but it's okay, you can get a fraction of them by paying ANOTHER 15 dollars to get the DLC they released. The DLC which has a whopping 2 helicopters. Yay. This games success is built by the community and I view ArmA 3 as nothing but a platform in which to create things - like lego. The AI is terrible. The lack of content is terrible. The developers woud rather release ""new V3S's"" for DayZ. ArmA 3 has a better engine than ArmA 2 - but lacks everything else. The DLC is helping out with the content problems...but only if you're willing to pay for what SHOULD HAVE been there. I honestly don't know what more to say...If you're on the fence about purchasing ArmA 3 and don't have a group to play with - I would not purchase this game until it goes on sale. tldr: When this game goes on sale for 10 dollars, buy it and it's dlc.

Oh, maybe I didn't make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I'll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn't this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It's your choice. So, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as ""Tenno"" who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don't worry about that. You will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don't have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it's good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are. Oh and there are parkour. Learn how to press ""WASD"" + ""LShift"" + ""LCtrl"" + ""Space"" in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them. Simple? Unlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won't be a simple ""run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep"" type of game. Never. There are things more important than that. Another merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won't happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually. Still, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won't say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren't much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I'm not saying there aren't, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here. Also, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn't much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive. So, in general, try Warframe. It's free. If you don't like it, drop it. Simple as that. If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums. Not much, but it is the spirit that counts, right?","Feb 20, 2014, 9:13AM",0,"Feb 14, 2014, 8:08AM",0.8380782918149461,562,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless,471,skillless,,91,1064.6,Peashooter,0,Recommended,,0,29,0,0

It is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game, and why I can't suggest playing it anymore. If you want to read more on it, I suggest going to the actual forums for the game (not through Steam, but through the official website). The players there are very active in posting, and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game, and talking about how DE's actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game, and from the direction they were once taking it. Instead of writing four pages, i'll summarize it into something short and concise. Again, if you want more specifics, feel free to go look into them, but I'll summarize, as I have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it, and what has happened. What it really boils down to is this: The company is using grind walls, and severely crowded RNG tables to deliver content. Which is one of the least creative, and worst examples of game design I have ever played. It wasn't originally going to be that way, but that is what it has become now. And considering it is supposed to be an action game, and not an MMO/RPG, the grind really kills the feel of the game, you are much less of a Space Ninja saving the solar system, and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons, all for literally no reason at all, due to the lack of story. In my 20 years of gaming experience, I have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted, and just outright ignore them. The community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players, and keep them interested, and avoid just getting burned out on the game, and patch after patch, they go ignored. From the past year of expereince with this game, the current state is that it is a fantastic concept, being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable, by an inadequate design and balance team.","Sep 11, 2014, 1:22PM",0,"Jan 9, 2014, 5:34PM",0.6868686868686861,198,"{'num_achievements_attained': 5, 'num_achievements_possible': 10, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.5}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/sumnus,136,sumnus,21.0,62,1053.8,Sumnus,0,Not Recommended,33.0,45,1,10,126

The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc) and a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with big  weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind! The engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top! The medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them! That is all the classes in team fotress 2! I hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server!

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases. Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired. On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now. We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community. I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for). Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.",,0,"Nov 21, 2014, 12:18PM",0.953472222222222,4320,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/weeabooshogun,4119,weeabooshogun,,201,345.9,Weeaboo Shogun,0,Recommended,,0,164,0,0

Now that the game is a stable release, this may not be a problem anymore, but it left a strong sour taste in my mouth. Even with this fact aside, it takes an extraordinary amount of time and luck to get better gear/items. In many games, you get small stat increases at relatively frequent intervals, or relatively frequent gear drops. Although I think the weapons are supposed to be sidegrades, the expensive and high-rank weapons are much better, albeit somewhat more situational, than the defaults. It takes a lot of materials to build weapons, and a lot of luck to get certain blueprint parts to drop from missions.

He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up.

Being ranked as the third most-played game [steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we? First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain ""class"". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class. Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as ""rocket jumping"". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team. Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates. Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :) One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market! All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670 Highly Recommended Be sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","Feb 2, 2015, 4:21AM",1,"Oct 23, 2014, 8:20PM",0.9029688631426501,1381,"{'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.5340909090909091, 'num_achievements_attained': 47}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse,1247,nerdhouse,36.0,134,256.5,Nerd House,10,Recommended,216.0,66,30,118,1827

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... ""Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds."" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most ""mature"" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a ""pay-to-win game"" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.","Jul 7, 2015, 5:00PM",3,"May 7, 2015, 4:18PM",0.9265734265734261,858,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.596525096525096, 'num_achievements_attained': 309}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi,795,emperorgandhi,17.0,63,930.5,[CotC] King Conga Gandhi,3,Recommended,266.0,1278,26,42,123

It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, ""Try your chances... Open a case."" Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water.

I was not disappointed. FM15 offers quite a bit of changes; everything from the 3D matches to the interface, gameplay and responsiveness. First off, the responsiveness of the game has greatly increased and improved. The game is far more responsive than earlier versions, and seems to go 'easier' on the processor. Second, interface. The interface has been changed drastically. Anyone who has played the previous FM installments will have a hard time at first with getting to grips with this new interface, but the change is definitely for the better. It is far more intuitive and works far better for newer players - And it might take a while to get accustomed to it but once you do, you realize exactly how much of a fabulous and welcome change it is. It makes the game navigation far easier, smoother and smarter - Which, in addition to the game's responsiveness, makes for a very fluid gaming experience. The 3D matches however, are not to my liking. The cartoonish graphics and unrealistic movement of the players reminds me more of FIFA 95' than a modern game. In my eyes, this is a step back from FM14 in fact, and hinders the game somewhat as the players score unlikely and unrealistic goals sometimes, or commit some extremely unrealistic movement and the entire feel of it is just awkward. But, now, my last and most important point: Gameplay. My god has this changed. The whole game feels incredibly new, the tactics screen is much easier to navigate through, the inbox makes your life incredibly easy (With interactions with players/transfers/almost anything can be done directly from the inbox when prompted with a message about it), transfers are *far* more realistic, negotiations about contracts too, player interactions have seen a major improvement, as have interviews with the press and team talks. Heck, even the backroom advice is better! The entire ""Interaction/conversation"" section is much easier to navigate through, works far better and more fluildy and seems to have a much greater impact on the game. Players seem to interact better and more often, and their interactions have real positive or negative effects on your team and the game and that's absolutely fantastic. It's one of the major things that has been missing, proper interactions. Many people have stated that the game is unrealistic, that they lose all the time or get injured all the time - And I have one thing to say: Review your tactics. The game is *NOT* broken. I've been playing for a while now with Arsenal (The most injury stricken team ever) and I've only had two injuries so far, both of them under three weeks out for the players - And the players are extremely susceptible to injuries (Jack Wilshere and Gibbs), so it's understandable. The scores have been realistic so far as far as I'm concerned, and from what I can tell, the problems people have been having directly link to their inability to adapt to the new game interface and inability to create proper tactics. The only real thing that bothers me about this game however, is the fact that the ""Current Ability"" and ""Potential Ability"" ratings for players seems to have decreased extremely from FM14 for some odd reason, and in some places it's truly uncalled for. I mean, for example, how can it be that Alexis Sanchez's Current Ability is only 165, when he's clearly having a *much* better season than, for example, Sergio Aguero whose Current Ability is around 180? That's just ludicrous. But let's be real, I'm happy that this is the only bad thing I can say about this game (And the 3D part), I mean, that's the least of our worries. Eventually, the Football Manager series heavily relies on tactics, not on individuals, and that's what makes it great and that's also what makes this flaw really minor. I highly recommend this game and see it as a step in the right direction for SI.",,0,"Jan 26, 2015, 2:49AM",0.736111111111111,72,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/LugzanRellk,53,LugzanRellk,,19,245.8,Nazgul Killer,0,Recommended,,0,0,0,0

It also offers replayability due to its vast counterpart; GTA Online and a living, breathing environment in the streets of Los Santos and Blaine County. Aside from the main plot, the game maintains its entertainment standard by offering its players with a variety of tasks, missions, random quests and activities. PC users that may not be as up to date can also try this as the game itself is optimized in a way to deliver utmost performance while maintaining its graphical fidelity. I must say, this is pretty much the only AAA game that deserves a praise in the recent scenario as minimal bugs have been found and those discovered are being eliminated by Rockstar.

Stamina, strength, stealth, and lung capacity are joined by a meter for their special abilities. These impact how long you can run and swim, of course, but also impact how well you handle recoil, climbing speed, take-off and landing in planes and helicopters, and so much more. If you want to bump up your flying skills, logic follows that you head to flight school. Similarly if youd like to have a bit more stamina, then riding bikes, triathlons, tennis, golf and other physical activities will help with that. Other than specialty skills, simply doing more of something makes you better at it  practice makes perfect. This is not an arbitrary add, but one with real. Also Graphically, Grand Theft Auto V makes the respectable presentation of its predecessor look pretty bland in comparison. What a difference five and a half years makes! Gone is the drab and depressing color scheme, giving players all the bright faux-California sun they can stand.

When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor DotA due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports. ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally Dota 2 would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a ""Hero"" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team. Welcome to Dota, You Suck, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it. That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however theres a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities. There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a Dust of Apperance, Sentry Wards or Gem of true sight, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time. In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity","Nov 25, 2013, 10:34AM",0,"Nov 8, 2013, 4:14PM",0.625,24,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.069686411149825, 'num_achievements_possible': 287, 'num_achievements_attained': 20}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/OOLockOn,15,OOLockOn,54.0,9,4747.3,sadpanda.jpg,0,Recommended,176.0,469,0,2,209

But the proof is in the pudding so for examples of gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/user/Jester814 Jester gives an in your face gameplay view ""That is a TANK!"" https://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi Dslyecxi gives the best hands down introduction to techniques, weapons and movement. If you want to know ""how"" it works - then go watch Dslyecxi. https://www.youtube.com/user/RHINOCRUNCH Go watch Rhinocrunch for shooting peeps in the back and running away screaming in fear they will come back from the dead and then pretending you fear nothing. Just Plain Stupid Funny. There are of course numerous flaws, bugs, and irritants that every multiplayer game has, but the one the gets most peeps irate seems to be the lack of contempory guns. After all the game is set in the near future, so the guns should be differerent (a bit), but I've seen Pashtun tribesmen up in the Hindu Kush who still carry Martini-Henry rifles left over from the 1880 Anglo-Afghan War taking potshots at their neighbours. Weapons never retire, they simply explode. The Vanilla guns are quite good, but I really wish there was a lot of the old guns from Arma 1 and 2, actually what I really want is a combat shotgun, like the Saiga and the AA12. Nothing says ""I'm peased to meet you!! MudderF###ker"" more than a Atchisson Assault Shotgun 12 gauge to the face. Which brings me to mods. Arma 3 isn't a complete game, its the basic framework upon which the modding community can builld mods, weapons, equipment, vechicles etc, for you to use. So the first thing you do after buying this game is go to: http://www.armaholic.com/ I think this is an excellent source http://play.withsix.com/ Download this, and wait three days as it figures out what cyberspace is or Steam'sWorkshop which I find problematic as it doesn't categorize items, and you find weapons, uniforms, vechicles and pretty well everything mixed up together, but at least it installs correctly, while the other two routes are really annoying to figure out. There are mods for glasses, hats, uniforms, beards, compasses. There are no end of special forces assault rifles, bazookas, sniper rifles, pistols the size of a shetland pony. There are exotic and weird mods for Star Wars, Halo, Zombies and Dinosaurs - yes I said Dinosaurs! Personally I think Bohemia should change its business model and simply pay the modding community for their best work, as in ""here young fellah, we like what you've done, sign this paper, have some money and we will stick your work into the offical game, now go make a career of this."" All said and done, is this game worth getting? Well do the math - almost 3000 hours gameplay for about $50 or Euros. Then it's not really a question - is it? but I still want my COMBAT SHOTGUN! and I want it called the SNARKANATOR!","Jul 14, 2015, 11:47PM",0,"Jun 1, 2015, 5:57PM",0.879598662207357,897,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065399597,789,76561198065399597,,108,2950.4,Snark,0,Recommended,,0,13,0,0

We've come a long way, but everything will end eventually, no matter how fun it was. If you are looking for the game's details, read the positive reviews, I will have a little rant here. A few years ago I found this game through the famous ""meet the series"", after I started playing I was instantly hooked by the amazing variety of gameplay, even though I do not play anymore do to the reason I will give below I am still active in the community, some of you might know as Gilgamesh from OpenGriefing. The game: With the nine classes and huge amount of weapons that come with it TF2 is a game which you can play for days, even months! Each class has their own individual role which is completely unique to it, you can play in all sort of ways, and there is so much to do it rarely feels repeditive. The community is nice, and although most do not appreciate the sight of a new player, there is still a huge amount of nice people. I my self have taught 4 players on how to play TF2 whom I personally don't even know, and I had great fun in doing so, and there more people out there that do the same. The game has a series of cosmedic items which add a lot of life and color into it. You can dress the big muscle guy called the heavy with his huge machine gun up with a fairy custom, or you can turn the German doctor called the Medic into a WW2 German infantryman of the battle of Stalingrad, these are two examples of thousands of possibilities. There are many game modes and dozens of maps for each, which let you play the game for an unbelievable amount of time with out getting bored once. These are just the official maps. There are tens-of-thousands of community maps which also enhance the gaming experience. The community: TF2 is a very old game, yet it is one of the most played multiplayer games even today. The community is very committed and it was the community that made the game what it is today. Valve kept the game fresh by releasing updates that always added more content with which you could play with your friends and have loads of fun. With that being said, here comes the problem: As I said, TF2 has a very committed and loyal community even though the game is from today's standards as old as the bread crumbs that are left in a toaster that one day have the fortune of being vaporized, leaving the toaster as dust. Now, valve always showed their appreciation for this through out the year by adding fresh content. This however, has changed. Valve, like other companies, has noticed the potential of modern competitive games, one genre of which is MOBAs. It is also very obvious that they have grown old of TF2 and want to work on different things. Their plan to keep the game alive, while slowly leaving it was to let their loyal community take over, which I have to say is quite an honorable thing to do. However, they have completely failed at it. The problem is, the community may be able to handle parts of the game, but not the entire game it self. It is impossible do to many factors. By this I mean, the community might be able to add content like hats and taunts to the game, but they can not expand the gaming experience, the expanding the gaming experience is exactly what made TF2 a special game, every year there was always something new to try out and after doing that, the normal game was appealing again, and the loop continued. But instead of fixing the issue, they just want to pull it through till the end, like dragging a bleeding body to the hospital but knowing that it won't make it. Warning Rant: They also treat the community wrong, they have gotten to used to the community of TF2 treating them like some kind of divine council. They think anything will satisfy it. An example of this is the ing ducks. Some people complained that the ""End of the Line"" not including snowplow, with Valves' response being 'It is too complicated for new players"", from what I have heard though, the did not include the map due to it not reaching their standards, which is fine by me. Also the lack of weapons that were promised by the creator of the animation did not appear, which was upsetting, but still bearable. What really shoved the middle finger up my  though, was the ducks. The ing ducks that cost 5 ING EUROS. FOR ING DUCKS! Is this some sort of joke? Was Valve thinking,""Ayy Lmao, ducks are funny right?"" from Valve and the End of the Line team. Without the ducks, I would have nothing to complain about, but if they seriously think that DUCKS will satisfy their loyal community after they miss out on the promised weapons and a new game mode, then must have ing plumbum in their water supply, They tried making up to it by rushing 3 new weapons which are all useless and uncreative. The creativity is what counts, not the effectiveness of the weapon. Pre-access, now for TF2 also! Another issue is BETA maps, they adapted the method of their platform into TF2. They release unfinished , act like it is finished but still needs ""fixing"" and let the community do all the work, instead of actually using already made maps by the community OR getting of their asses and finishing them. The beta map Cactus has a ing holes everywhere! It is also so monotone, I cringe when thinking valve could even put it in the game. What they appear to think of the community: They take us for a bunch of clowns, juggling around in the circus with a red nose and wacky hair, riding on a one-wheel making ""toot toot sounds"". They put disclaimers on their ! ""For expert players only"" they write in captions under their new Pre-Access game mode. Who ever complained to them, that some game modes for too complicated? Someone with 0 neurons in their skull, succeeding at surpassing the stupidity of a pigeon?!? The game mode is just as ""complicated"" as the other game modes, there is nothing that could irritate new players, if you exclude all the unnecessary glitches. Hats: As it worked in the past, adding more cosmetic items usually was endorsed with a lot of positive responses from the community, this was because they added fun cosmetics, while adding more content for gameplay. It was a balance of a innovation and fun, always the right mix. But now, they just try to make us suffocated in cosmetics. This can be do to 2 reasons: 1. They just want to add more cosmetics to.. recreate Barbie simulator. 2. They realized that the game is dying and wana milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill (same thing goes for ducks) Servers: I will try to keep this short. Most Valve servers, the servers I personally enjoy playing on the most. Have  BETA maps on them. Most TF2 servers went from TF2 to DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I remember always finding at least 3 full servers of a single map, for each map a year or two ago. Now I have luck if I find a single full server of a map. To end this: As I mentioned before; ""They realized that the game is dying and wanna milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill"", the game IS in fact actually going down the . Look at all the TF2 youtubers! STAR_ and Jerma have stopped playing the game! Why? Because there is nothing new, and they have a bitter taste because of the recent decisions of Valve regarding TF2. ""So what if two youtubers quit playing the game, it happens all the time."" When a pretty much TF2 only channel with at least 90% of its subscribers being TF2 related, quits the game because the company is ing up, then it is very obvious that there is something wrong! This is not just YouTube, it is also on my steam friends list, I used to see at least 10 people playing the game at any given time. Now it is rare to see anyone at all play it, and look at the size of that list! With the majority being hardcore TF2 Players. This game is dying and Valve needs to seriously step in before it bleeds out for good.","Mar 19, 2015, 6:06PM",0,"Mar 19, 2015, 6:04PM",0.6003210272873191,623,"{'num_achievements_possible': 106, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.518867924528301, 'num_achievements_attained': 55}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicOfGilga,374,EpicOfGilga,32.0,249,2740.0,Gilgamesh - A great loss Iwata,0,Not Recommended,284.0,192,173,2,109

The game became somewhat dull and continuously repetitive despite the ''updates'' it was getting. Only thing stats changes did was to  up the balance and make me want to play it less. Then there is the updates which added new weapons... Really didn't helped at all, it ed the game even more. Valve saw their precious TF2 that got them so much money from the mann co. microtransactions is dying and they thought adding more stuff to it will make it more interesting and that people will come back running to it because of the new content. Wrong move. Today, The Gun Mettle uptade was release. From now on, 3 July 2015 will mark the day when the TF2 we all knew and loved has died and was replaced with a more cartoonish version of Counter Strike. Good job, Valve. Good job... Edit: Some users might agree with this here, maybe others not, but I'm pretty sure the only way Valve will ever have some of the old TF2 players back in the game is to launch a damn update that removes all this new weapons, stats changes and CS:GO crap. Or atleast some official valve servers for vannila gameplay WITHOUT this  updates. Some of use like then, some don't. Why would you try to get new fans by adding all this  when you had a really huge community backing all of you up!! You had supporters, people that actually loved the game, the vannila one, without all this new updates that completely changed the game's feeling. Or is it that you saw the game is slowly dying and thought adding new stuff will make it last longer? Wrong move. The game is soon becoming as old as 8 years, what made you think a game like this will not eventually die? It happens, you can't avoid it. in' learn that your game is dying and you people are not able to bring it back alive with all this updates which add new content to it. I still do like and support you Valve, you make great games and all that, but sometimes you make some the most horrific and staggering decisions one could make. And I don't wish for you to become like EA or anything close to them. I want you to be the company we all know and love. That's all. Stop thinking you can bring TF2 back to popularity with all this new additions.","Jul 4, 2015, 1:05AM",0,"Jul 3, 2015, 1:19PM",0.625,16,"{'num_achievements_possible': 16, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.375, 'num_achievements_attained': 6}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/cancerousahegao,10,cancerousahegao,88.0,6,494.2,Akumu,0,Not Recommended,28.0,63,4,7,263

The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further. Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system. Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker. This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this.

It wouldn't be fair to review this game with a negative bias like the one I have, so I'm presenting facts as objectively as I can here in as fair of an environment as I can. Warframe is a scifi third-person action game that plays more like a firstperson shooter on steroids. It essentially feels like a cross-over between older fast paced games like Quake and Unreal Tournament, with properties akin to that of a more modern shooter. That being said, I can't call into question the fun other people have playing this game, so I can't consider that a worthwhile approach to determining whether or not the game is worth paying any money into or not. But I can say it's fair to judge other factors, for example... This game is based heavily around ""Modding"", the use of items to upgrade weapons appropriately, and Crafting, the use of materials picked up from fallen enemies / broken containers or enemy storage lockers, to build things like weapons and characters to use. It takes a very long time to gather these materials, and because of this, it has been referred to as ""Farming"" when a player repeatedly runs the same mission, or runs a mission for a very long time in order to gain more of a material out of it. Now, here's where my reasoning comes in as to why I don't like this game as much as I could. It takes too long. I am someone who has a lot more free time on my hands than the average gamer, so I haven't had to buy much in this game using the in-game currency Platinum ( which is purchased with real world money ). Now, that's fine. Having micro-transactions to skip the time consuming part of a game is okay, because you can still have the option of acquiring it yourself over a longer period of time with simple hard work. What's not okay is something Warframe players refer to as RNGesus, the Random Number Generator. What's also not okay is the extensive nature of ""Farming"". A significant portion of content in this game is hidden behind a 'grindwall', or rather, an extensive task or list of tasks that MUST be performed before you can access certain parts of the game. This is not as bad as DLC, and it isn't as bad as micro-transactions in some other games, but it can be fairly irksome at times. All in all, this game is fair about how it treats many things, especially how it treats micro-transactions ( in the fact that a huge number of things can very easily be acquired with time and effort ) except for one problem... Pricing. It effectively costs around $10 to get a typical weapon, and $15 or so for some of the more expensive ones. This is a problem that is very hard to argue against or in favour of because of an even larger problem, the value of time. Calling into question the fairness of the pricing of micro-transactions in this game is difficult because you call into question the value a player has of their time. Is it worth spending $10 to get a weapon now, or is it worth spending a day to collect the credits and resources to buy it, then wait an additional 12 hours for it to craft? Is it worth spending $15 to get a Warframe ( Playable Character ) immediately plus bonuses, or is it worth it to spend several hours acquiring the parts and the credits and resources, then waiting approximately 4-5 days on average for it to build? The problem here in my eyes is that it is not worth it, typically because in the time it takes to acquire these things, I could have done much more in other games, or even worse, for $15 I could've bought an entire other game. Now we move on from pricing, and Platinum / Microtransaction issues, to another thing that irks me. Balancing. I admit that Warframe is technically still in beta, and that many things still do need to be complete, but this does not feel like a beta game any longer. There is a huge quantity of content in this game, which I would easily value as being worth well over $40 ( Generous for a game that has no form of very specific story or singleplayer campaign + no straight up form of sandbox, as well as being restricted to missions that are run from your Liset, which is essentially your 'main menu' of sorts. ) The audio quality is impressive, and the visuals are even moreso; The animations for melee weapons are both practical for gameplay and impressive to actually look at, though the game begins to disappoint when it comes to the secondaries and primaries which all share one unified means of holding primaries and holding secondaries, where you hold all primaries as a rifle and you hold all secondaries as a pistol. There are unified reloading animations for some weapons, although thankfully it also seems many weapons have their own unique reloading animations and firing animations in some cases. Bow weapons all share the same animations, and no one single bow weapon has its own animations unfortunately thus far. Countless assets are recycled in this game, although this has no significant effect on gameplay so I won't consider that something to tally against. ""Recycled assets"" in this case being many enemies who share the same model with different colours. For example, an enemy known as the Nullifier makes Abilities useless ( Abilities in this game are essentially akin to spellcasting from other games, where you can throw fireballs, set up shields, etc. Many things really. ) I personally dislike Nullifiers simply because they detract from an environment where the use of Abilities is one of the main things that makes the game stand out from similar shooter games. Many enemies in this game rely on actions that knock you down ( Rendering you unable to fight back by any means ) using attacks that, in some cases, are completely unavoidable. Thankfully unavoidable knockdowns are rare, although the true problem is not the knockdown itself, but the fact that knockdowns have no counterplay ( Once you're on the ground, you're unable to do anything to make your character get up faster / unable to defend yourself even if only rolling out of the way of incoming fire ). This game has plenty of cover, but no cover system to make greater use of it, thereby unfortunately making no use of an otherwise potentially unique addition to an otherwise straightforward gameplay system. The enemies are fairly intelligent, and make use of cover to the point of it even being annoying in strange ways at times, for example enemies will frequently change course repeatedly ( Running back and forth or even running in circles ) because they are trying to move towards two different sources of cover simultaneously. AI bugs aside, the AI is intelligent and fun to fight against. There are countless weapons to use, but another unfortunate thing is that with how the game treats enemy scaling, the most useful weapon always ends up being the one that cranks out the most damage. Generally speaking, you will always perform better with a weapon that does much more damage than another weapon that operates in a more unique fashion ( For example the flame-thrower weapon does so little damage and has so little effect on enemies that it's generally just a better idea to use a heavy machine gun or rifle that does vastly superior damage overall ) Artificial difficulty is a topic commonly talked about in Warframe, with the most common subjects being the repeated nerfs and buffs being done to characters who typically aren't deserving of the treatment they get. Another topic tends to be the way in which difficulty is ""improved"" or ""upped"" as the game gets into higher levels, with enemies becoming textbook Bullet Sponge enemies and increasingly cheap tactics such as unnecessarily frequent knockdowns or locking the players' movement and so on. All in all, I can't really recommend this game to people who either lack free time, or are at all prone to being frustrated by what can be described as an unfairly balanced environment.",,0,"Apr 26, 2015, 4:59PM",0.648562300319488,313,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nocturnyl,203,Nocturnyl,,110,2303.2,Sll cl,0,Not Recommended,,0,16,0,0

Selection of 9 heroes, while every of them is somehow specialized and has different inventory to choose. And every chosen unit has it 's own statistics. Unbelievable 500 achievements will get you and surprise you, meanwhile for comparing with other games it 's a big shot. Chance of gaining equipments to inventory of your warrior or any bonuses which are going to be very useful in the game. It 's important to point out that there is a possibility of playing as single player or cooperation or any other methods, but it's useless and needless.

You can find screenshots jam packed with weapons, attachments, camos, characters, and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because Bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development. That might have been an accpetable option, except Bohemia didn't fully commit. Because of this, a lot of the game is just copy-pasted nonsesne. Almost all vehicles use the same HMGs, GMGs, and auto-cannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle. All static weapons such as the mortar, GPMG, and anti-tank/anti-air missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions. There's maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game, all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety. An example of this is the MX and Katiba. These each have their respective variants in the CQB, regular, grenadier, and DMR roles, but each one of them is the exact same. They have the same ballistics, same damage, same recoil, same magazine capacity (even though the MX has a much longer, thicker mag than the Katiba,) and hell, even the same round! Take a look back at ArmA II, you'll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go, but in ArmA III everything feels the exact same and in MANY cases it IS the exact same. They couldn't add a different auto-cannon for each faction, but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear! Another moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future WITHOUT actually adding any futuristic content. Any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that ""look futuristic."" The Merkava replaces the M1A2 Abrams tank in the least sensible move since Jimmy Carter running for a second term, the Bradley is replaced by the Namer, another Israeli tank, and come to think of it, this entire game is a showcase for Israel. This doesn't make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where it's spread out amongst all factions, but it made a lot of sense in the original story when Israel was annexed by CSAT and CSAT started using Israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their Soviet-made equipment from yester-year. This is a great example why they should've committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game. When you get down to the core of it all, all that matters is the gameplay. Unfortunately, that is horrendous, too. The game feels like they watched Rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in ArmA II, combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge. Players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying, even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill! Full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you don't you're going to be the one in a body-bag. Seriously, they took a simulator game and turned it into Call of Duty. The encumberance system is another horrible mess. Seriously, your character is not fit for military shape because he can't sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break, and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction, because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to China and is shaking harder than Michael J. Fox with a cold. Another noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is. Seriously, even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and, at times, outright freeze-framing. All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the ArmA series, because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience.",,0,"Jan 19, 2015, 7:51PM",0.60919540229885,87,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.40425531914893603, 'num_achievements_attained': 19, 'num_achievements_possible': 47}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/kebabremover,53,kebabremover,17.0,34,411.9,Oooo Ukropy Privyet,0,Not Recommended,191.0,177,6,4,94

This game's longevity is certainly one of it's many strengths. As an FPS with so many weapons and features, it remains extremely comprehensive and balanced (Regardless of what most players say). Weapons are added every now and then, and current weapons' stats are always under inspection for balance issues. The control is extremely tight as all source games are, movement always seems fluent and never clunky. The skill ceiling for movement/mobility is extremely high and allows for lots of very tricky moves (eg. Rocket/sticky jumping, sentry jumping, strafing, etc..) Generally the skill ceiling for TF2 is very, very high; with almost 3,000 hours at the time of posting this i am nowhere near the skill level of more experianced players. The community is still strong and persistant as the game ages and brings in new players. An overall friendly and welcoming community awaits new players, as well as a thriving competitive scene in both Europe and the States. Not to mention the incredible fan-created artwork and short films on youtube and other sites. TF2 has an incredibly involved trading scene which was born from the staggering amount of hats and cosmetic items that you can get. The trading scene can be brutal at times, but nothing quite stands up to the feeling of getting a sweet new item after spending time trading up for it. (Oh and did i mention you can sell TF2 items for PayPal cash if you're advanced enough?) In summation, Team Fortress 2 is a game for the ages.

Seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now. I have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the community. It is sad. It is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance, unprovoked to people they do not even know. For instance: A kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match. Hey liked how I wrecked you last round? (No reply from my friend) Oh what you got nothing to say? Must be too poor to buy a mic. (So poor yet he owns a computer right?) (I then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance) Random other guy who must have been this childs friend starts. What the f#$% you trying to do? (My vote to kick the initial child fails) (They try and kick me) Shouts Kick this f@#$^% out of here he's trying to send me pictures of his d$%^ (I get kicked). Now I don't care about being kicked out of a game. There are many other lobbies I can join to play and try to have fun on. What I care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game. Yeah I get it, it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many trolls and immature children out there. The problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on. The problem is when I, like many others, sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant, abusive, conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing. Literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults. There is absolutely no need for it. There is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game. It ruins everything video games are meant to be about. Besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues. The game is goofy with it's cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously. If you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it. Trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players, you will lose money, you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did. I realized this after seeing how much I spent on the game, the situation I explained above and when I started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time (which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying). Looking at the lucrative micro transaction style system involved, it is at least how I see it addicting. Who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them? Constantly buying more keys, to open more crates, in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a profit (it hardly ever happens). It is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward. You may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you? Can you sell it and make a profit? Yes. Can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike, or a baseball bat, or pay the rent and bills? Nope. Every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into Steam. So you don't really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment. It gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is it's only purpose. Spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing. I let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than I should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end. I regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that I have lost my enjoyment of the game. Overall I had fun. 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it. What I realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with. I started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server I was on and that killed my enjoyment. Listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring. I guess maybe I am just at an age where I have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment. Will I miss playing tf2? Probably not now that I have expanded my game library. Will I play it again? Likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun. I will never invest my time, like I used to, back into this game because it is really not worth it. I would recommend if you want to have some fun (100-500 hours) try Team Fortress 2 out, BUT my warning and the point of my review, DO NOT invest a significant amount of time and/or money into this game. It is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community. Everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game.",,0,"Jan 1, 2015, 5:32AM",0.532258064516129,62,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.874251497005988, 'num_achievements_attained': 146}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/shmugle,33,shmugle,66.0,29,810.3,Shmugle,0,Not Recommended,28.0,125,4,1,123

We shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy. This went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in ""dibs"", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened. In order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies. Babylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders. I offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted. North of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome. While they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon. I had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them. My civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall. Eventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world. They all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway. Democracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you. Through this, I came to understand American foreign policy.

I wrote something for real! These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think!

Playing Arma II was not such a pleasant experience, and I was very happy that I haven't wasted my money on this when the Day Z mod came out, So I bought Arma III expecting something as bad as the previous Arma. But I was surprised. The graphics, movement, squad management, driving and many other features were massively improved. I`m not even talking about shooting. Recoil and gun damage is so realistic. But the inventory system probably is the most improved thing since Arma II. Now you can easily see whats on the ground, or in the vehicle, or simply add attachments for your gun ( which are awesome! ). There`s no more arrow clicking and usual inventory lag. The only things that needs fixing are glitches and AI. Glitches should be fixed in future patches, but the AI need some work done. The AI could be both very easy to take down and extremely punishing at the same time. Sometimes AI just stands there for couple of seconds and then starts shooting, or instantly spots you and shoots you down in a few shots.

Especially in hit registration area. If I shoot the enemy four times and see four separate blood stains on the wall behind him, I expect him to get four hits if I'm not suffering from bad ping/lag/lost packets. This is not how it happens on CS:GO. You can never be sure about how much damage you have dealt and how much will it take to finish him off because your hits don't register. -5-stack competitive mode. In this age of online gaming, I would expect to play with my team against various teams around the globe, which makes competitive really competitive. Getting thrown in with four  who swear in their native language and do random team damage, trolling in general against a 5-stack is not fun and I don't think it won't be fun for them either. -Decent community. Switching between this and Red Orchestra 2 is like having cancer, beating cancer and getting it back again. If your community mostly consists of 12-16 year old players who think they are the best because they get sum awsum killz and refusing any kind of friendly advice or criticism, or even formed tactics for the round, you can't claim to be a competitive game. -A competitive FPS game requires serious and especially strict moderation if it's based on random matchmaking. No griefing should be allowed, leaving before game ends should lead to permanent ban after a couple of times, instead of overwatch, which is recruiting everyone with 150 wins and Nova I rank, a professional or semi-professional team should be established. Without moderation, the game easily turns into Wild West.

It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. ""Where do I start?"" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Graphics: Great for ""Gaming"" PCs, this has possible great graphics/textures on a Great PC. sadly for user on Laptop sorry but you're out of luck until Rockstar wants to update the game. On my PC the map loaded fine, occasional Lag for a sec to reload the map. amazing game for PC On my Laptop, Geez talk about bad...game occasionally crashes when trying to load(in fact crashes more than often) the map will try to reload several times while you driving/moving/looking out for your apartment. see the thing is that they made a game without a ""low"" or ""Very low"" setting, maybe take away bushes, gates, certain details that just generally make it to hard for a laptop to work. Gameplay (Story Mode): Overall gameplay of Story mode is great, being able to switch from characters and characters having different abilities, being able to buy cars you love and just mess around. playablity after the story, okay I guess, side missions and stuff to do afterward, still can do whatever you want after the story is finished. that is about it. Gameplay (Online): Great, Fun, Challenging. GTA Online takes the best aspects of the Story mode and puts them into Multiplayer. own garages, cars, tanks, planes, weapons, etc. being able to fully customize vehicles, guns, your character. multiplayer is a struggle though inorder to keep up with certain stuff, such as rent/insurance/ammo/clothing/etc. Overall as a conclusion!

It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, ""Try your chances... Open a case."" Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

That didn't happen. Instead, what we have now as ArmA III is simply an OFP converted to COD/BF/CS:GO. This game is dead, and not worth spending a dime on it. PROS + Improved graphics, soldier equipment is detailed + Improved movement features, leaning, several sitting positions etc. + Bullet ballistics + Big areas available for play as an Islands CONS - Horrible and non realistic human damage system (aka CS-like) - Fictional and not practically realistic weapons - Helicopter can lift and carry a heavy MBT while it is using its main gun in the air... - Sniper can shoot a person sitting inside armed IFV... - Aircraft/Helicopter simulation is at the PS2 arcade flying sim level... - Tank/Vehicle control is simply W A S D + Mouse click, horribly simplified - Vehicle movement on a terrain is a joke, totally screwed up physics - Helicopter can lift 5 ton truck, drop it from 10m and truck continues to drive normally... - Flying physics for Aircrafts/helicopters is a laughable joke - Shooting enemy Aircraft with AA Vehicle is all about ""button-press-hold-click"" - TONS of bugs without attention.

The developer, Digital Extremes, is the studio behind The Darkness 2 and Dark Sector. Digital Extremes gets involved with the community, by providing regular patches, video updates and participation in the forums. Digital Extremes borrows heavily from their previous game Dark Sector that was developed in 2008 and scrapped on 2012 in favor of making Warframe. Summary +Great Atmosphere/Environments +Great Weapon/Skills/Character Selection +Great Clan System (Dojo is impressive) +Great Developer Support(updates are good chunks and come often) +Great movement opportunities(Running across wall is fun) -Grind(Blueprints/Materials) Gameplay The gameplay is pretty solid, if you are looking something flashy like Devil May Cry, you are not going to get it here. That being said, the variation of weapons really make up for this. The warframes themselves are great in terms of variety and design. Each one has stats and abilities that set them apart, which results in a fresh experience every time you play with a new warframe. Being able to run along walls or run up them makes mobility in the game more dynamic in terms of getting from point A to point B. Rank System Rank system emphasis on developing experience with Warframes, weapons and equipment rather than getting exp in general. Your rank is a signature of how much firepower you have accumulated in your arsenal. Since rank challenges vary it will test a wide array of your skills from marksmanship, mobility, and combat abilities. This system results in the player being more well rounded by fleshing out your skills in a multitude of areas. Customization Upgrading, transmuting, and fusion are several methods to improve your options. The level of equipment acts as points for attaching mods. This allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages, to fight certain factions or missions. The forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further. Atmosphere The setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game. The atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments. The new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks. Updates As someone who made a long guide for this game I can say that their updates are so solid I feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant. This is most apparent in their UI changes they have made which made my videos a-bit weird to see for the newer players. Clan The dojo is one of the nicest additions I have seen yet. Not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it. The dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp, and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research. Pay to Win? If you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured thats not how it is. The only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots. You can put time in and get the same results you just can't have many Warframes/Weapons at once. They also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas. For example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process. So instead of buying the weapon, you can collect the resources, craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you don't have to wait. Grinding? Yes, there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials. Generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the pay-off aka the warframe as soon as possible. The grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints. This is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability. So if you do not mind grinding, buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough. Conclusion Overall Warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a Pay to Win game. If you are looking for an interesting game.... just give it a try, I am sure it won't disappoint.","Oct 21, 2014, 10:19AM",3,"Nov 26, 2013, 7:34AM",0.76453488372093,688,"{'num_achievements_attained': 10, 'num_achievements_possible': 10, 'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos,526,astralchaos,42.0,162,699.0,Falem,5,Recommended,497.0,607,7,55,921

We shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy. This went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in ""dibs"", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened. In order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies. Babylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders. I offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted. North of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome. While they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon. I had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them. My civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall. Eventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world. They all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway. Democracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you. Through this, I came to understand American foreign policy.

Takes some getting used to. -Injuries are a little over the top and excessive, so I'd like to see this get fixed or at least toned down. Seriously though. It's been a couple of times that I haven't even been able to reach the third game of a season without a little more than a third of my team being injured for more than 2 weeks. C'mon, SI. Cut us some slack. -Scouting is actually useful! -Still a lot of fun to make fun of other managers, too. -There's this thing now called ""team talk"" during a match where you can talk to your whole squad besides the pep talks. Doesn't do much, but it's there. -Keepers are dumb and rebounds happen on 90% of shots. -Incredibly hard to sell players. *IF YOU ARE NEW TO FOOTBALL MANAGER, READ THE FOLLOWING* I came from FIFA. Playing as a single player got boring and online matches aren't my thing, and I wanted a deeper manager experience, so I tried out FM14. And I became addicted. It's a hell of a lot of fun managing a football club with this much detail, and there are so many clubs to choose from that it's very possible (but kind of hard) to make a rags-to-riches story with either a single club or your management career. If you're okay with the shallow managing of FIFA, then you do that. No hard feelings. It's not like I'm on the development team. *IF YOU ARE NOT NEW TO FOOTBALL MANAGER, READ THE FOLLOWING* I'd say this is worth it over FM15, even in the beta state it's in as of me typing this. Just about everything is improved except for the amount of injuries that happen to your squad. Just be prepared to be fumbling around with the new UI for a bit as you get used to it. Trust me, it's a better, cleaner UI. P.S., this is a review of the BETA, so I should be updating this periodically. One more thing that applies to the beta and the full release (when it comes out): I really wish they could make this run in 64 bit as well as 32 bit. 64 is becoming more and more common place and it would make the game run a hell of a lot faster.

And yes, for a free to play game, it is. But it's not as good as the games it steals, sometimes shamelessly, from. It's everywhere in the game, from the sliver of a storyline that exists, to the weapons, to the combat mechanics. It's unoriginal and not as good as the sources Warframe takes 'inspiration' from. Now I'm all for taking a great concept from another game and making it even better, but it's never been better. The combat system is directly comparative to Mass Effect, and while Warframe has tried to move away from it, even the UI used to be a dead steal from Mass Effect. But again, not as good. Excellent for a free title perhaps, but the developer of Warframe does not exactly lack the funding to make original content. And that's my main issue with Warframe; They can't. It's like making a WW2 game called ""Medal of Duty"" or ""Call of Honor"" and branding it as something unique. When Digital Entertainment, the developer, release a patch, it tends to break the game. After 2  years and 15 major updates (although an inspiring amount) you would think they would be able to at least check their own code before unleashing it on the main audience, but something always breaks. Usually in spectacular ways. A patch goes live to re-balance a warframe (class) and it breaks the matchmaking system, sending you into a singleplayer game and the online chat into a singleplayer experience as well. How or why the coding for a warframe has anything to do with the ingame chat system, nobody knows. Rebalancing the game usually goes the same way as patches. Usually it fails and often in spectacular ways, no matter if it's your class, your weapons or the enemies you use them on. Of course there is a forum for suggestions, but unless complaints are voiced in the hundreds or more, it goes largely ignored. But I digress. Warframe is at its core a good game. An original idea it never was, and don't let anyone fool you there, but a good game. Especially for a free to play title. It does have a healthy view of what an ingame cash-shop should be like, and you never need to look at it to enjoy any aspect of the game. Sadly it is managed by a team of people who does not understand coding or game designing properly to maintain their original vision of what Warframe should have been. There are flaws in this game that have been flaws since Warframe went live but that have never been solved, to the point where one might wonder if they lost the original sourcecode somewhere along the way. Play this on a casual level if you are into free to play titles, but don't waste your money on it. From a design point of view Warframe was always a mess and 15 updates later it is only worse than where it started.",,0,"Feb 21, 2015, 9:34AM",0.5714285714285711,14,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/halabaster,8,halabaster,,6,1460.4,Hala,0,Not Recommended,,0,0,0,0

CSGO is still broken as  with ladder hitboxes and other  that volvo doesnt care about because they are too busy making new animations for knives and creating new operations -_- 3/10 rating still stands This is a honest review of the game Counter Strike Global Offensive or CSGO. Lets just start off by saying that previous counter strike games really have been amazing. Now CSGO is the newest installment in the series. What seems and is a fun game is plauged with problems. Lets start off by the community. The CSGO community is one of the most toxic communities out there just as bad as the Dota2 Community. They will put down new players, troll and just overall have BM while playing the game. Really valve does nothing to punish ""Griefers"" and others so the trolling will never really end. Another Problem is hackers. Hackers plauge the world of csgo at all ranks and skill levels. Some may be blatant and some may be more conservative. Point is that valve has really not done anything to fight hackers. VAC sucks and takes weeks to ban a hacker, while overwatch has been implemented its a time consuming process that cant always be accurate. Because of the low price of the game hackers can make endless accounts and continue to feed valve the 15 dollars for csgo so that they can continue to ruin other peoples time. Valve really has ignored the community in many ways aswell. Not implementing 128 tick servers, adding stupid stuff like Music intros to players and not doing productive things like fixing exploits or overpowered things like grenade tagging. A massive problem is also skins. They may look pretty but they ruin the game. Now I understand that valve will never take skins out of the game because it is a massive amount of revenue for them. But skins really only lead to professional players throwing matches... Nothing can really be done about this as much as the big Orgas (organizations) try to stop it from happening. Players will find a way to do it and will throw for skins when competing in small tournaments. Smurfs are considered a problem by some but I see no feaseable way to stop them so I will not be talking about that. Surrendering is also an issue. Teams playing competitive matchmaking can surrender a game but only IF one of the players decides to sacrifice himself and abandon the match getting a cooldown. When playing against a hacker in addition to getting aimbotted time after time 1 player must be punished for abandoning the match in order for the team to forfeit. This game CAN be good but valve is not doing what they need to do to fix the issues and instead adds their cash grabs to the game. The issues will persist and more and more players will leave the game. This game had great potential and is fun at first until you play enough.

It was touted as a reinvention of Counter-Strike in general, aimed towards new players and especially, console audiences (one year and a half after release, both console releases have become entirely redundant) and featuring new, community-designed game modes (two Gun Game-inspired modes under the umbrella ""Arsenal Mode"", which has now been all but abandoned by Valve). While the game was in a disastrous state at the beta's launch in December of 2011, its premature release in August of 2012 did offer a much improved experience... but it still simply wasn't ready for release. The console versions themselves were poorly made, and the main PC version offered few features, few maps and an overall lacking gameplay component, especially on the competitive side. Now, close to December of 2013, two years after the game first materialized as a closed beta, it's safe to say that after a full year and a half since its Steam release, with consistent, robust and uncompromising post-release development by Valve, CS:GO is a completely different product. With the makings of a balanced monetization platform in the Arms Deal systems (paving the way for a possible free-to-play re-release), huge new additions in gameplay and graphics alike, and a renewed and refreshing focus on the competitive side of the game (both in-game and out of game, in some of the many prominent LAN tournaments), CS:GO has reached a point where it's clear that it has become equal, if not superior to CS 1.6... and make no mistake, this could be only the beginning for the game. There is still much room for improvement - certain aspects of gameplay which hamper the experience for both casual and hardcore players (aimpunch, weapon balancing, and the lack of proper tutorials or any reliable way of explaining deeper mechanics); the lack of content outside of the main ""Classic"" game mode and the lack of support for the nigh-deprecated ""Arsenal"" game modes (honestly, a control point or holdout or VIP mode could go a long way towards giving players more to do). I also feel a broader selection of weapons (both base weapons in the buy menu and sidegrade loadout weapons) and equipment could freshen up a static and rigid gameplay formula (which in Dota 2, for instance, changes radically every six months). For the most part, however, this is Counter-Strike, as deep and skill-based as it's ever been but with adjustments and improvements which help it feel more modern and dynamic, without compromising its core gameplay mechanics. If they play their cards right, CS:GO could end up being greater and more expansive than either of Valve's previous multi-year, post-release and free-to-play game experiences (DOTA 2 and TF2). Either way, now's the time to get on board; and for the mandatory horrendous pun for my closer: now's the time to go, go, go!","Nov 30, 2013, 1:50PM",0,"Nov 30, 2013, 7:52AM",0.6923076923076921,39,"{'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery,27,thepastisbeyondrecovery,,12,1172.1,Vic,0,Recommended,,0,0,0,0

Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, ""Mann Up"", gives rewards upon completing a ""tour"". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly.

I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun.

It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast.

While already a dubious concept, it has been executed horribly. For example: *Valve receives a 30% cut on mods. The publisher determines their cut, in this case 45% goes to Bethesda, leaving modders with 25%. Money IS paid not in store credit but instead in real cash, but only after the modder accumulates a $100 cut, which will not happen for most mods. *Due to a lack of copyright on mods, there are mods which are being stolen and being resold as a paid mod. There is also no protection against any mod being stolen, in a legal or DRM sense. *There is no quality control on mods in the Steam Workshop, and modders have no obligation to provide a working product or to update their mods, which will lead to refund concerns. *Due to many free mods' dependencies on what was other free mods that are now becoming paid mods, end users will have to pay for those mods in other to use other mods which depend on them. This will be happening with the SkyUI mod. *Mods such as ""Midas Magic"" are having their free versions removed by the modder after he attempted to integrate pesterware for the paid version into them. *P2W and cosmetic mods will likely dominate the market over expansions, as less work needs to go into those and that is where ""the money"" is. The entire thing reeks of bad business practice, and is a mess. A better way to execute donating to modders is to set up a tip jar system, where users can pick up and thoroughly test and play with a mod and then go back to the modders' workshop page where they can give modders a tip out of their Steam Wallet. This system as it stands shafts users, and it shafts modders as modders have to sell $400 out of a single mod to see any sort of money.

The game engine, match engine and what is referred to as the AI, actually just a randomisation engine based on mathematical equation, is defective. The players do not have any realistic actions or movements. The defensive simply does not work, especially crossballs which is impossible to defend against. Your central defenders will try crossballs from deep regardsless of their shortt passing and less risky passing. Your team will miss 4-5 Clear Cut Chances every match, the opponent goalkeeper will always play high above level and your opponents players are always faster then yours. There has been so much focus on the administrative part of the game, that the actual playing a match part of the game has been overlooked. And as for the administrative part, it is boring and doll. Constant and repeating media questions before and after every single match, makes one set of the assistant manager to handle it. Individual traning for players is gone completely in order to facilitate new players, basically making the game easier to the point of being dumb. And this is in normal mode, they originally made the FM Classic mode for that purpose. There are a few positives like the new scouting system and staff system, and the UI has been improved as well. But those things are easily forgotten in the face of the overwhelming onslaught of errors and lazy programming. All in all it is hard to see how this game got through testing... Just kidding, SIgames never test their games before release. And they do not care about correcting errors and flaws. Most of what I have written was reported doing the beta fase of the game, but nothing was done about it. The beta was version 15.1 and the game is now on 15.1.3, so 3 versions later and nothing has changed. My advice, do not buy this game. It is defective and it is unlikely that it will ever be fixed. It reminds of FM2005 and FM2013. They were defective from the beginning and it was never fixed. PS. The metascore is faked.

They DO NOT balance the current game mechanics such as pellet/damage spread and random crits. They DO NOT Penalize those who are literally unable to play the game at an acceptable level.

For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now. Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry. Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games. At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing. Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release. Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles. For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.","Nov 25, 2013, 3:00PM",0,"Nov 25, 2013, 2:55PM",0.8612059158134241,879,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.45, 'num_achievements_attained': 9, 'num_achievements_possible': 20}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/murrayl,757,murrayl,19.0,122,280.1,MurrayL,2,Recommended,60.0,709,7,47,455

This was a difficult decision, but none the less my career will be full of adventure and creativity im sure. Journal Entry 2 I stumble upon a small village in the middle of a lush green valley. The town is very cute and has lots of character, The trees lay down gently caressing the mossy roofs of the residents old homes. There is a quiet calm stream the flows through the center of town. yes.... this is my ideal place to begin my career. Journal Entry 3 I start by scanning out the town guard's positions, from what I can tell there are only 3 of them. With such a small town who would ever think to need more guards?.... perfect... Now we just need to carefully pick our victim. I scan around, I see a few older ladies, a few older men, A boy walking with his dog.... But who do I choose? ... so many choices Journal Entry 4 While scanning the small crowd of residents I hear a women's voice from behind me say some type of vulgar insult about my clothing. I turn around to see a ugly women with a sneer on her face. She sticks her nose in the air and shoves passed me. I can hear her mumbling something else as she walks away but can't quite make it out. I think we found our first victim :) Journal Entry 5 I decided to quietly follow her, she goes to the market and picks out fruits and meats, she wanders over to the stream and glances at it for awhile, she makes small chit chat with another women. Finally she starts walking out of town down the road for a ways. I quietly take cover in the forest and sneak along. She leads me to what appears to be a small mill on the edge of town. She walks into the older looking home next to the mill. Its still daylight and I don't want to risk an attack that she can escape from... better wait till night. Journal Entry 6 I wait until about 1am, its pitch black out and all seems quiet.... time to get a closer look at her home. I lockpick the door and sneak inside. The walls are decorated with all manner of animal heads, swords and shields. She has the fire lit and the light from it bounces off all the corners of the room. I find her quietly sleeping on a bed in the corner, I pull my dagger from my cloak and raise it. With one mighty stab she gives out her last breath and sprawls out silently on the bed. Now to leave my mark, earlier on I purchased a small quantity of blue flowers from a market, this will indeed be my insignia. I position her arms so that they are across her stomach, I then gently place the blue flower in her chest. A respectful position and a perfect mark for my career. Journal entry 7 I have cleared out most of the valuable items in the house....*Door slams*.... ""OH NO"" I hear shout from behind me! Its the husband! I should have done my research better, I should have noticed the large pair of boots next to her bed, they were far to big for her... How could I be so stupid. The man turns and runs out the door... I'm going to have to catch him or else im done for. I give chase, as I burst out of the door I can see that he will get to town far before I can catch him with my dagger. I pull my bow out, im only going to get one shot, if I miss im going to have to make a run for it. I take a deep breath and steady my aim, I carefully pitch my bow up and down... trying to gauge his distance as he runs. I release my arrow, it sails gracefully through the air... then I lose sight of it....Did I miss??.. I wait...Horrfied... hoping... begging.... I see his body fall face first to the ground, a perfect shot, a perfect kill. Journal Entry 8 I quickly run over to the mans body, we are now only about 20 feet from town but luckily there are no guards walking by yet. I grab hold of the body and drag it into the woods. I decide that maybe its time that the guards know they are not in control anymore. I drag the body to the mouth of the stream that flows into the town. I pull him into the water and let go, the stream's current is weak but its enough to float him into the town. I proudly strut into town to await his body's arrival, the guards are all gathered around the center of town with lit torches talking. I wait patiently beside the market.... then I hear one of the guards yell ""A Body!"" The guards and 2 other residents run over to investigate, gasps and mumbling begin to develop around the group. I turn away and start heading out of the town.... My work is done here...

First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive! BUT: There are some things Valve has to change really fast! 1. Cheating: There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it! 2. DDOS-ing: I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure! 3. Smurfing: Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this! 4. Patches: Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem! 5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver): Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***! 6. Community: The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly. Over all: Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore!

The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota 1. In Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since I'm one and two-thirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players. Dota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things. In my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy team's Ancient or defending your own Ancient. The goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing. Dota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and you'd get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense. Why did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually don't do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you don't respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of self-defense. Early in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams. Once you've bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they aren't people so it's ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. :) Once you've spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system. Once you've levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passive-aggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice. Once you've become the best all-around person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, (resets between games, so you never get bored) it's time to go tear down the other team's towers (those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you) and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts.","Nov 25, 2013, 2:19PM",2,"Nov 12, 2013, 5:59PM",0.846153846153846,39,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.047619047619047006, 'num_achievements_possible': 84, 'num_achievements_attained': 4}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz,33,Shatterwaltz,11.0,6,939.4,Ibitsu,2,Recommended,58.0,22,6,12,176

Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. The game returns you to the continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.The combat in Skyrim is the tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.Some death blows result in Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. All in all, Skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant RPG.","Sep 20, 2014, 4:07PM",0,"Sep 20, 2014, 4:06PM",0.9062500000000001,64,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0, 'num_achievements_possible': 287, 'num_achievements_attained': 287}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus,58,ownosourus,125.0,6,37.6,ownosourus,0,Recommended,905.0,5737,2,535,1938

Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us.

First of all I love the game series sooo much and I have played them all since GTA 1. So I hope that my review will be quite objectively. Please feel free to leave a comment or discuss issues with me. After playing GTA V more than 300 hours I think now its time to discuss buisness! PROS: -The singleplayer in this game is awesom .... there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more. -The storry from singleplayer is great, good redline through the game with lots of fun missions and great heists. -Graphics on high end PC are quite nice, could have been better :D -Fantastic ambience throughout the whole world ! AMAZING ! -Masterpiece of soundtrack! The radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music! -Great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect. -TV and Internet ... all thumbs up :D CONS: -The multiplayer!!! (I have waited sooo long to play a GTA game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people! but it is impossible) -Permanent laggy gamesessions. -Connection errors all the time. -Friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently! -Hours of loading screens!!!! (Im running this game on high end PC with SSD drive and still loading for hours) -very low payout rate of money! (a friend played GTA V on PS3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days ... so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists! it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever) which takes me to my next point ... -HACKERS!!! The damn game is full with hackers .... everywhere!!! Rockstar doesnt seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time!!!! jumped through 5 puplic lobbies, encountered 7 hackers. breaking the whole realm, shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons, teleporting with godmode, screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker! I`M SICK OF THEM ....I ALSO AM SICK OF  PLAYERS JOINING THE LOBBIES ... FIRST QUESTION ASKED: Is there a hacker here, I need money!!! WTF ... such a-holes should be banned too, right from the moment they typed in this question! Dont missunderstand me here, I HAVE A 0 TOLERANCE POLICY FOR HACKERS! They ruin everybodys game expierience!!! And people who abuse hacking methods for their own good are the same scum in my opinion! Last words: I really love the game and I will continue to play it, but im not sure if i will give the multiplayer another chance! I will also give the game a good review because the game itself is a fantastic masterpiece of game design! The multiplayer will get all thumbs down from me :D ROCKSTAR PLEASE SOLVE THE HACKER PROBLEM!!! I would totally recommend GTA V to everybody. BUT, be aware of the multiplayer! Maybe wait a year or so until it will be on a steam sale for half of the actual price! You will totally not regret buying it then!

I'd love to talk about how much fun this game is. Not only do you have the staples of deathmatch, races and missions, but you can even relax and watch some TV with friends, play darts and pool, even play some golf. There is just so much to do that it's hard to imagine getting bored. Infuriated, however, is really easy to imagine. You have this amazing game waiting for you, only to constantly run into weird, impossible to fix issues. Online is finicky, and does not give you any clues as to what's wrong. Want to join a friend? It might not connect, but instead of telling you, it'll throw you into a random server. It might tell you the servers are down even though they're not. There's no easy way to start a job or a mission with friends, you either join someone else's job randomly or, if lucky, actually get to invite your friends. There's no easy way to get this all set up. You get to fight with this while dealing with long load and connection times, only to find out it didn't work or put you into the exact wrong game, or, even better, it throws you right back into single player without asking. On top of that, the mouse drag (even with ""raw input"" selected) issue make aiming incredibly difficult. If Rockstar can fix these glaring issues, this will easily be one of the top PC games. When you can get the actual game to run, it's a great experience. Until then, though, get ready to spend an infuriating 45 minutes at minimum to play with your friends, and god help you if anything, and I mean ANYTHING, causes you to be disconnected from them (including, but not limited too: joining a mission that only had one slot available, being forced to join a game instead of forming your own, they load faster than you, the list goes on.)

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate. The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.","Apr 30, 2014, 9:52AM",0,"Nov 25, 2013, 2:01PM",0.8862696443341601,2418,"{'num_achievements_attained': 47, 'num_achievements_possible': 178, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.26404494382022403}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornyKelleher,2143,CornyKelleher,24.0,275,118.7,Corny Kelleher,0,Recommended,15.0,871,18,6,362

Warframe is 100% free. You will always have access to all of the game's content (except cosmetics) without needing to pay any money. If you want cosmetics, you have the option of spending money on Platinum (the game currency) or you can just trade other players for Platnium. I've played over 3,000 hours without spending any money because I just sold items to other players for Platinum and then used that Platinum to buy cosmetics. You control a Warframe. There are over 20 Warframes to choose from and they all have unique themes (Fire, Berserker, Stealth, etc.) and special powers (Fireball, Warcry, Smokescreen, etc.). There are hundreds of weapons to choose from (Rifles, Snipers, Shotguns, Launchers, Pistols, Swords, Axes, etc.) and every method of killing is perfectly viable. I have the most fun when I use all the tools available to me. For example: I'll use my Fire Warframe to burn five enemies, then I'll use my shotgun to shoot another six, and finally I'll use my sword cut up the rest! Warframe is a co-op game, but it's still fun if you want to solo. There is also PVP, but it's not balanced and not the focus of this game. Warframe updates pretty frequently, so there is always something new and interesting to do. Warframe has good graphics, but doesn't require too much from your computer.

Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation. You then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence. Before what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding. You awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn. Why oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it? Ghandi is a complete , he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10",,0,"Oct 13, 2014, 3:13AM",0.974878444084278,3702,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.814371257485029, 'num_achievements_attained': 136, 'num_achievements_possible': 167}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePoopScoop,3609,ThePoopScoop,20.0,93,144.5,The Poop Scoop,0,Recommended,75.0,13,75,1,88

First of all, this review is not a humorous one. I'm writing it seriously to give information about this game. Because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters. I think this review will be informative for these people, gamers who has spent couple of hours like me, knows everything i am going to try to tell. After this short introduction, we can start: -Russians' problem is not about being Russian. Due to the game's popularity among Russian players, there are too many bad (always swears, doesnt play as its a team game, doesnt speak english in eu servers etc.) Russian players. But there are also too many nice Russian players. Briefly, the problem is not about being Russian, if there are 10 gamers in dota, 4 of them will be bad players, if there are 1000, 400 of them. Thats the point. -If you want to play this game to get relaxed, dont do it. After few matches you will find yourself more depressed, angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed. The bad players are the reason for it. As an illustriation; you started a game to get enjoyed, looked the picks, someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said ""me mid"" or ""me solo"" etc., ok thats right you are still relax, you picked a support for your team, they somehow fed the enemies, ok still you are relaxed, they started to argue with each other, they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement, ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry, and then you will lose the game. This type of games are not so rare in dota. 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell. Therefore, it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota. -Then, why people still playing it too much? Why there is not just bad players in the community now? Because it is addictive. You can not get rid of it. If someone trolls your game, you want to play again and wish to play with better players, if you win the game, you want to win again and increase your mmr, if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back. Shortly, you will want to play again after every game. However, if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want, this reason is pointless for you. -Meaningless mmr system. When i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited. Because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players. However, the system is completely meaningless. Player profile and skills are same at 1k,2k and 3k mmr. Once you get your mmr, it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25, every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before, player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k, when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc. It is completely up to your team. So, how people get too high mmr's? They have this mmr at the begining. And how they did it? There is no clear information about it. Valve does not announce how it is being calculated. For example, i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins, i played support and carries, buy wards and couriers when i was support, i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry, but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr. This system also a fact about this game's addiction but doesn't help kind players about creating a better environment. -All in all, i dont recommend this game just because of its community. The game is a master piece, master of MOBAs, it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game, it has great graphics etc. However, it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it. On the other hand, if you have a great mental power and patience, play it, i completely recommend it. This review was written for normal patience leveled people. I dont say ""Dont waste your time, go and do some social activities"", if u want to play video games, dont play it go and play more enjoying games. -Lastly, i have an advice for valve, it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota. People who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players' matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players (as defined at the beginning) they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased. Now, it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling. I hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends :D ************************Some Suggestions************************ I wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate. I lost my will to play dota. However then, thanks to some sensitive comments, I started to play dota only with my friends. Now I have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as I mentioned in my review months ago. -As some people say in comments of this review, play this game with your friends. After writing this review I have rarely played solo games and it feels better. -Participate in some tournaments. After lots of bad pub match experiences, that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience. You can participate in ESL's or other platforms' open tournaments for free. -Finally,never give up! You can encounter very kind players as well. After a bad pub game performance, your teammates maybe say ""uninstall dota"" etc. but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends. Just do not give any importance what they say. You can see similar things in this review's comments section. There are very kind, sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing, offensive comments. Same is true for the player profile in dota, just dont give any importance what the haters say! ***Final Note*** For the guys who say ""why don't u recommend the game while playing it too much"", please read the review again, this review is a complete answer to your question. GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN :D UNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN :( Edited: Game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected. ""Some Suggestions"" section added. Thank you all for suggestions, comments and rate ups.

It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team. Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking. On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay. I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up. This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.",,0,"Jun 22, 2014, 9:54AM",0.833333333333333,12,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.7604790419161671, 'num_achievements_attained': 127}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/pentium4,10,pentium4,13.0,2,1584.9,pentium4,0,Not Recommended,146.0,0,0,1,30

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate. The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.","Apr 30, 2014, 9:52AM",0,"Nov 25, 2013, 2:01PM",0.8862696443341601,2418,"{'num_achievements_attained': 253, 'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.48841698841698805}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornyKelleher,2143,CornyKelleher,24.0,275,118.7,Corny Kelleher,0,Recommended,15.0,871,18,6,362

You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win. The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable. You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally.

Here you go: I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience. I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.","Jun 8, 2015, 11:40AM",0,"Sep 9, 2014, 12:32PM",0.9617021276595741,705,"{'num_achievements_possible': 285, 'num_achievements_attained': 285, 'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain,678,ernestmurdertrain,36.0,27,1440.5,Ernest Wolf,0,Recommended,148.0,43,20,21,379

In this game, you'll be sent back to the times where people fought with swords and bows. A brilliant setting, if you ask me. The game lets you do whatever you want. You can customize your character to your own style, own personal favorite race, and you'll be able to fight any style you want. Do you want to play the sneaky Elf archer, with the bow? No problem. Do you want to play the sneaky Kahjiit thief, with the daggers? No problem! Do you dislike weapons and love to use magic? No problem, there's even lots of different spells, either Destruction or Illusion, maybe Necromancy is more your style? Being a healer is no problem either! You can make your own weapons by Smithing, you can make your own potions by gathering ingredients and mixing them into a potion with Alchemy, you can upgrade your weapons by using Enchanting, there's so much to do! Want to settle down after some adventures? Get to a town and drink mead at the inn, or purchase a house or a piece of land to build a house, with self-found materials, or maybe bought materials? Whatever you want. There are so many different playtroughs, so much quests to play, heck, I've played this over 275 hours and I still haven't completed all the quests!

Choose from over 16 different races and wield the best weapons that Morrowind can provide you, such as a toothpick, a chainshark, and the most famous weapon that history has ever seen, the M82 Barrett 50 Caliber Anti-Materiel Rifle. Battle your way through countless amounts of enemies, all with differing stats and alignments. Join a variety of teams for good matches of Capture the Flag, with infamous clans such as the Brotherhood of Steel, NCR Rangers, The Sisters of Chaos, and many more. And of course, get indulged in the famous story of Skyrim, choosing sides in the epic war waged by the Cupcakes and Pancakes, while also going for some quest about having a tea party with Alduin, the famed Rabbit Dragon. Are you man enough to kick Alduin in the face and take his lunch money? Find out, by spending 20 (Or less, depending on sales) bucks and playing Skyrim. Or your friend could just get it for you.

He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Fhrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust. Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy. Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support. Hitler actively sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.",,12,"Dec 4, 2014, 4:11PM",0.5714285714285711,42,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.216666666666666, 'num_achievements_attained': 13, 'num_achievements_possible': 60}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061946957,24,76561198061946957,8.0,18,699.0,Sadseal,0,Recommended,23.0,33,6,8,59

With it's barren vast open world landscape & it's cast of interesting characters skyrim is the definitive RPG experience that you will ever get to play. In order to elaborate on this, I am now going to give you the reasons as to why you should get The Elder scrolls V Skyrim. Pros Flying mammoths Gorgeous game world with 512 x 512 & 256 x 256 textures ( 1024 x 1024 with the HD texture pack ) Excellent companion AI that hinder quests by stepping on to traps as well as triggering them for you in order to make you feel more immersed in the game as well as blocking doorways & always being spotted by the enemy especially if you want to roleplay as a sneaky character. This is another feature that makes you feel more immersed. No dependence on mods. Unlike the other games in the franchise Skyrim is not dependent on mods to keep it interesting even after 300+ hours of gameplay cause who doesn't love replaying the same opening sequence for the 6th time. Easy & glitchy dragon fights. Who needs challenging boss battles when we can just kill dragons & feel like gods. Screw timing & skill required in your average game boss fights. Skyrim did it right so much so that you don't even have to lift a finger in most fights. You can just let the other Npcs handle it for you. It's not like the game says that you are the only one who can kill the dragons. Broken quests. This is the most important feature of the game as it encourages the player to keep playing the game again & again in order to complete that quest. And at times it also forces the player to delete saves & hence reducing progress you have made so far in the game.This further increases your game time. Bugthesda are one of the true pioneers of this feature & other games have also started adopting this. Paid mods is the latest innovation that bugthesda in collaboration with valve have brought to the table for skyrim. Although Skyrim is not dependent on mods but it is still a good option for the players cause who doesn't want to pay for something that may or may not work & could possibly harm your saved game. To be honest i can't think of a single con for this game cause it's just so perfect and i think i have made that very clear with the features mentioned above. I think my only gripe would be that the soundtrack is just so meh in my humble opinion. Final verdict : 11/10 Skyrim is a game that definitely deserved the critical acclaim that it got back in 2011 although it was released in the same year that saw games like i don't know Deus Ex Human Revolution, Batman Arkham City, Dark Souls, Uncharted 3, Witcher 2 but hey those games don't stand a chance against skyrim & all of it's innovative feautures.

The dev team is a bunch of hardworking people who outdo themselves with each update.

The events are super fun, the weapons modding is full of tons and tons of options, there is an ever growing list of items and warframes, and there is just so much to bite into in this game. I am a person who enjoys deep detail and stats and customization, and this game speaks to that need very well, in addition to the utter beauty of the visuals. Oh, by the way, it's totally free. The only place I find a little lacking is lore. They have done a lot of worldbuilding and set up a great stage for their characters but have not embellished them or the history of the world very much. This grows with every update, of course, but I feel it is growing much more slowly than the game itself is. I'd love to even just be able to read more somewhere, if nothing else.

These are all game play issues: 1) A FEW Players ratings. Messi is 20 everything as usual but he didn't have a great last season like he usualy does. Some players are quite underrated such as Di Maria and a few Atletico Madrid players. Ronaldo has 15 acceleration.... (not sure how that works.) 2) Some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainable.(not sure if it's a bug or not). Sometimes the defenders just heads/pass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it. 3) When players dribble they run into teamates far too often. Which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life. 4) This is a very irritating one. Players misses 1V1's far too much, if they have 4-5 '1V1' chances they'll manage to score one.... This is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply don't miss all those chances. You could say that they are having a bad game but it's happening consistantly throughout the season. Also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance. But our players just blast it strait at their keepers. 5) Final one so far... Players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable (sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target). So far I havn't seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition. Please could you fix these issues.

Team Fortress 2 is a game I believe can really fit with all kinds of gamers, from all kinds of scenes. Whether you're into MOBAs, already into FPS's, or just a general player of games, TF2 can find some way to work itself into your heart. Part 1: The Classes The classes in Team Fortress 2 are all well-balanced characters that fit into a special role of a team, their well-craftedness leaves the real struggle to the player to make the class shine above all others. The roles of each class don't even stop at what the class could really do. There are so many sub-classes and builds and weapons that change how the entire game functions, it's versatility expands far beyond just what it's labelled as. The classes and their wonderfully fleshed-out personalities with different backgrounds helps you to invest in them and really become a part of them, and possibly have them become a part of you. Part 2: The Weapons Weapons in TF2 aren't really improvements to the stock, which makes it different than alot of other games. They're another type of playstyle, another way to play the game. Want the Heavy to be even more of a damage dealer? Use the Brass Beast. Want a reward for all those headshots you're getting as Sniper? Use the Bazaar Bargain. The weapons help broaden the possibilities and types of play of the game, chances are you won't meet players with the same loadout, and even better chances you won't find them using the same kind of playstyle. All in all, I know there might be some sour apples in the bunch, but the range of weapons and the manners in which you can use them is spectacular, and helps others find classes they like. Part 3: The Hats You knew this was coming, admit it. The game's cosmetic system isn't all that there is, but it's one hell of a huge chunk. Ever since the first few hats were added, it changed the game. From the beginning, it was one for one, a hat for a hat, but soon, the seed of economy was planted. The economy grew and flourished, values were established. currencies were made, and the true spirit of the war-themed hat simulator came to fruition. The economy is a real shining gem in this game, while prices may seem absurd, it really is astonishing how a video game managed to grow an economy that easily translates virtual goods into monetary value with the unboxing of a crate. The community lives around this creation, molds it, creates it, they coexist peacefully and abide by one another's rules. Not only does the market shine, but the cosmetics themselves, too. Each piece can be equipped together in no specific order (aside from some restrictions with clipping, of course), meaning a bunch of combinations for your signature, unique look. This furthers the customization from weapons, and really helps to make you, you. Overall In the end, TF2's a flexible game. No matter what genre of game you're most accustomed to, TF2 will have a place in your heart. Interesting, quirky characters set in the middle of nowhere, fighting over who-knows-what. Plenty of methods of customization to make it fit you. A community that's pretty darn great, and a good bunch of pretty-looking hats. This game more than earns my 10/10, for as much as it counts.

It's flippin' free!)",,0,"Aug 11, 2014, 10:26PM",0.9375,16,"{'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.761363636363636, 'num_achievements_attained': 67}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Froobilicious,15,Froobilicious,32.0,1,2338.0,Honest,0,Recommended,77.0,326,0,3,111

One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CSs weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although its added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, its not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of 40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at 12, which I think is $15 in the US. Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and youre still alive you simply gain $0. The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game. http://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpg Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova youve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, its for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level. Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way ground breaking its been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace. I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you dont understand whats so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6u26YTpIF0 Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldnt play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when its on sale at 75% of! Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not. I would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review? Why was that, whats wrong with it?","Mar 25, 2014, 3:37PM",1,"Nov 25, 2013, 2:43PM",0.769770706598034,2137,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.774131274131274, 'num_achievements_attained': 401}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathdisturbance,1645,deathdisturbance,32.0,492,709.3,DeatH_D | ETF2L.org back 31st,1,Recommended,372.0,82,35,5,178

Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.","Jul 20, 2014, 10:33AM",0,"Mar 4, 2014, 9:24PM",0.8757602085143351,1151,"{'num_achievements_attained': 118, 'num_achievements_possible': 132, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.893939393939393}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatorplayspacman,1008,Predatorplayspacman,12.0,143,3299.9,Brovahkiin,0,Recommended,63.0,44,47,7,126

Many modders are going through hard times now facing morale decisions and fear of public backlash because of this carelessly stupid system, to the point that some have been discouraged from continuing their work. They have an even unnecessary burden recklessly placed on them of scouring the Workshop, making sure their freely-shared content is not being sold as someone else's work.

This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site.

Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.","Jul 20, 2014, 10:33AM",0,"Mar 4, 2014, 9:24PM",0.8757602085143351,1151,"{'num_achievements_attained': 118, 'num_achievements_possible': 132, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.893939393939393}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatorplayspacman,1008,Predatorplayspacman,12.0,143,3300.7,Brovahkiin,0,Recommended,63.0,44,47,7,126

All i can say is i didn't realise i purchased ""Loading Simulator 2020 HD Edition"" Kidding aside, to elaborate, of my '91hours' on record at this moment, its safe to say ive spent 3/4 of it loading! Holy Crap man. -On start up, -Online mode, -Missions/Heists --Starting them, --inbetween choosing more missions --finishing missions/heists (which constantly crash while loading which gets you locked loading with no way out other than to either Alt + F4 or try join someone elses game with Rockstar social club thing if anyone else is on), Though this is a personal niche of mine. --Cutscenes (that you cant skip & some you can after you have seen it before, if one person hasn't seen one before in heists sit back and watch a good 5min odd cutscene each time). Thats just some parts that need loading. I know what your thinking ""well of course you need to wait for loading stupid head!"" And your right! good job fellow nublet. See now this wouldn't be an issue at all assuming loading times were minimal and the amount of times to load were minimal, but hey that would be too mainstream, 5min loading time average~ assuming you don't time out/Crash and need to load up the whole damn game from the beginning and as mentioned above there's just too much, if you want to make people load up 5 mins for 2mins of gameplay thats fine i guess, at least make sure it god damn loads up. Now lets get into things that need fixes. -like joining friends, sometimes you cant join friends from a number of issues, like having not done tutorial(even though you have done it before). -Also an issue where you may be buying stuff from convenience store dude for snacks, and if someone comes around and holds it up while your in it, you are stuck there, unable to move or get out, even after the thing is over. -Missing weapons, sometimes you lose weapons/lose all weapons and need to buy them all again. -idling time out, 2min idle time it seems. Which is fair enough but i personally think its too short, maybe 5mins.(only a problem since you gotta load in again yay more loading screens. Which funny enough if your stuck in a loading screen you cant idle out which is the only thing i can imagine the idle out being somewhat useful) In fact, as I am typing this, I am stuck ""Loading"" Launching a mission for the past 10mins with no way out because you cant just press esc to leave, the only way out is to alt + F4 and exit the whole game and load it up from the beginning which takes about 5-10mins just to boot up. I just...... no words. Wait Loading simulator 2020: HD Edition. ALL that negitive aside, the game runs great when it works. Which is funny because sometimes as your playing, the game still crashes. Happens randomly though not too often. Though i wouldn't know having not really played much of the god damn game. Sorry too busy crashing at loading screens and sitting through loading screens to get a really good run. End rant :P Seriously though, i would recommend this game easy balls if people could actually run it without pulling hair out at every minute of loading.","Apr 28, 2015, 10:07PM",0,"Apr 28, 2015, 10:14AM",0.6578947368421051,38,"{'num_achievements_possible': 65, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.507692307692307, 'num_achievements_attained': 33}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008114077,25,76561198008114077,7.0,13,146.4,Number 2,0,Not Recommended,36.0,22,1,1,93

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally though you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and ""tryhardish"". Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't ""hate free"". I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more ""tryhard"". Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being ""OP"") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero ""pay to win"" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game. To put it roughly in perspective, it's like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a ""fooping idiot"" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? ""Uninstall Skyrim, noob."" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? ""Learn to play, tard."" It's like that. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine)... which is 50% of the time. Sometimes not even when you're winning. It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. But realistically, why should you even have to? Videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you can't have fun half of the time, the game isn't worth it. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're golden. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting ""a stick in the mud"" player on your team. Great game with a bad community.",,0,"Jan 31, 2015, 9:33PM",0.75,24,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.772455089820359, 'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_attained': 129}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/DOG-E,18,DOG-E,24.0,6,13.5,DOGE,0,Not Recommended,80.0,36,0,16,76

A very fun game. Especially, very addictive and good for relaxation, but it depends how good you are at the game or on your picked class. Classes & Teams: There're about 9 classes in the TF2 : [Offensive Classes:] Scout, Soldier, Pyro, [Defensive Classes:] Demoman, Heavy (Weapons Guy), Engineer, [Support Classes:] Medic, Sniper and Spy. Each class has it's own strength and weakness. For example, Spy has a low health, but he can kill can instantly by backstabbing you. TF2 has 2 teams: BLU and RED. They hate each other, and they attack each other. Nothing interesting. Maps (Levels) & Gamemodes: Maps can be different (pretty obvious). But unfortunately, maps can affect the gameplay, because like I said before, each class has it's own weakness. For example, Sniper can kill you pretty easily in a very wide map, and you can get annoyed. Each map has it's own gamemode. Here is a list of all official gamemodes: Capture the Flag (ctf) Control Points (cp) Territorial Control (tc) Payload (pl) Payload Race (plr) King of the Hill (koth) Medieval Mode Special Delivery (sd) Mann vs Machine (mvm) Robot Destruction (rd) Arena (arena) Mannpower And here is a list of unofficial gamemodes: Highlander (TF2Center.com) 6v6 (TF2Center.com) Saxton Hale Mode OR Freak Fortress (vsh) Randomizer Slender Fortress (sl) Prop Hunt (ph) Dodgeball Zombie Fortress Surfing (surf) Jail Break FortWars And many more. Hats/Cosmetics: You don't need them to play a game. Players usually care so much about cosmetics, because they want to look good and feel good, while they play a game. Most of them, spend about $500 on the game, only because of the hats. Players also care about the ""qualities"" of the items. Some qualities can be very expensive, so I don't suggest to spend money on crap. However, hats are not the only ones. Players also waste money on weapons, due different qualities or reskins. IF you really want to get hats, then I suggest you to read this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248435114&searchtext=Free+Hats IF you want more hats, then I suggest you to understand, and learn some basics about the TF2 Trading Community, and about trading itself. Here is a guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158754458 Major Updates: There are 2 different kinds of TF2 updates: Official Updates and Community Created Updates (they're official, too). What's the difference, you ask? Well, it's pretty simple: Official Updates - Are created by the main creator/company called VALVe. In their updates, you can find new gamemodes, new weapons (which are usually made in the summer or in the winter), new maps, bug fixes and especially there is a 90% chance that VALVe is going to add new hats, made by the community from the Steam's workshop. Community Created Updates - VALVe usually cares what community makes, but they don't allow community mess with the balance of the game, meaning VALVe doesn't allow us to create new weapons, which can have different stats, and especially add new maps. (However, VALVe added community maps only in the beginning, when TF2 was still new and fresh. But now everything is different, because in nowadays TF2 became as a very popular game.) So like I said before, VALVe actually cares what community creates. So VALVe likes to add new hats and new weapons (just models) created by some talented people from the community. But majority of the community hates to see, that every new update has a new hat. And to be honest: It's normal. If you didn't know, there was a big over hyped update called ""End of the Line"", and it was actually the most useless update in the TF2. It had tons of cosmetics, a new taunt, a new weapon, which is a actually a reskin with no stats. Before an update arrived, the community really hoped to see a map called ""Snowplow"" with the new gamemode, but when the update arrived, the map was canceled by VALVe. VALVe said, that the map is too confusing for new players . Later, that sentence became as a meme , because other maps made by VALVe are more confusing, than a ""Snowplow"". Anyways, let's move on: Unbalanced Gameplay & Weapons: TF2 has 2 kinds of players: F2P (Free to Play) players (aka noobs) and P2P (Premium to Play) players (aka experienced players). Imagine BLU team full of noobs, and RED team full of experienced players. Is this a balanced match? Heck no. REDs would win every bloody match. However, in VALVe servers you may find a voting system, which allows any player to vote something. Here is a list current voting types: Kick Player Restart the Match Change Level/Next Level Scramble Teams Disable Team Autobalance Eternaween (Allow Halloween-restricted items for two hours. Player must have an item to enable this voting choice.) So imagine again those 2 teams again: Imagine, that you joined the BLU team, and you see that the teams are not balanced at all, and whenever you come out of your base - you always die. So you decide to vote to ""Scramble Teams"". So what do you think what's going to happen? The voting will fail, because your enemies are having fun AND because your teammates (noobs) doesn't know how to vote at all, or just completely ignores the voting. Now let's talk about weapons, shall we? Nah, let's not, because VALVe finally fixed all those unbalanced weapons. I could mention them like a long time ago, but now it's not worth it. I will still save this title, just in case. The Story: Well there is a story in the TF2, but unfortunately you can't find it in-game. You can only find it in the official TF2 comics. You can find comics in the Official TF2 Website, right here. [www.teamfortress.com] The Community: The community was great, until TF2 became for free. Right now, if you go to any official VALVe server, then you may hear some screaming or crying children with microphones. I hope your ears doesn't explode. To be honest, TF2 community is still great. It depends where you live. Usually, I really love to play with Americans. I never loved to play with Europeans, because they love judge each other, and sometimes they're so speechless. How cruel! What is a Premium Account? Premium account means an Upgraded account. In the beginning you can only have 1 backpack slot. If you buy something from the Mann. Co Store (in-game store), then your account will be upgraded and you will have 6 slots in your backpack. It's very important to have a Premium account, because 1 backpack slot if not enough for you. I suggest you to buy a Mann Co. Supply Crate Key . Once you bought something from the Mann Co. Store - don't use it again. Use it only to buy keys. Once you understand all basics about trading - you will know what to do with your bought key(s). (Just trade your key for the metal, and then buy tons of hats and weapons, as much as you want!) Overall, my rating is 7 out of 10. Remember: Once you start to love this game, then there is a small chance, that you will leave it. Everything depends, what you like or love, or how (quickly) do you understand things. Also, I am very sorry if I was very rude or mad in this review. It's because sometimes, TF2 can make your feelings hurt, especially your sanity. If you don't want to risk your life, then simply don't play this god damm game.

The multiplayer is ungodly imbalanced. Cheaters 24/7. hacked lobbies, etc,etc. All that we couldve expected. Most of the time the fps eats the damn dirt as well, so optimization isnt that improved from IV. The lack of bulletproof windows makes you an easy target in almost all lobbies. Most weapons are either unpowered, or overpwoered. No balance was considered in this game whats over. I still play but thats becuase im level 82, big whoop. Still fight hacked lobbiers who are level 8000. Overall this game is one big sham, my recomendation, wait until the lobbies die off and then invite some friends. Becuase you can trust randoms with jack . Heists are okay, but the lack uniqueness honestly. I dont like the concept where your forced to use preset clothings on the standard option. I know, i know immersion. But it makes your character appear like a damn clone honestly. The cops are OP. Like...SUPER OP example: Fire a silenced firearm in a desert where nobody can hear you about 5 times....2 stars....and about a 15 minute wait until that goes away out of sight. Even more annoying about the cops is when your trying to take a bounty, or any other pvp stuff in a lobby matched and they focus on only one of you which is annoying as . I hate the concept of the multiplayer lobby having you show up as a bright dot on the map 24/7. I hate, i hate it, i hate it. Theres no privacy, none of it. Yeah yeah yeah. You can disabled the blip with lester. But seriously, when has 1 minute honestly made a ing difference? NOWHERE! My opinion, only allow friends/crew to see your blip. You can keep the nametags up, but why the hell would you add a ing blip permanently? Worst concept i've ever seen in my life. I can see it being only usefull on bounties, friends/crew (as mentioned beforehand.), and players with a high hostility rate. Otherwise, its just a terrible concept. Even more complaints on weapon balance is that rockstar doesnt know WTF their doing. Their version of balancing the weapons is adding free dlc weapons, which are superior to the vanilla weapons, that can be unlocked at the very 1st rank. Example is a lock on missle....the ing thing has more damage than the rpg. Yet it has the ability to lock onto people. Welp, there went balance out the window. Now instead of using a rank lock we might as well be giving miniguns as ing candy. Honestly, dont pay $60 for this in its current state, dont even pay $40...its not worth it...the story is pretty decent, but the MP is just thrown out of propertion. Its a failed state of deciding it wants to be, call of duty with permanent UAV mode on, battlefield name spam 4, the sims (towards customization and money game),hardline's cops and robbers, and a socialness game. It makes no ing sense.....oh not to mention in GTA online you have the durability of a god damn cracker, yet hacked lobby levelers can withstand about 3 shotgun blasts point blank and/or more than half of a AR mag to the chest. With the introduction of heists, everyone is just a damn zombie. instead of brains though their feeding on the most BOOOOOOORING gamemode that is now overused. The heists themselves dont even give you that much RP, and just mostly money. Even then you'll fail about 90 times on just the 2nd heist unless you have level 100s. Meaning your better off doing missions, its faster, and more lucrative in the end. Also the game gets grindy AS  later levels. About 80-100 you'll do about 20 heists fully before you get to 100. In a way its almost like rockstar WANTS you to cheat, just so they can ban all of their own player base. Oh and no MP modding, disappointing.

We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big. I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on ""high"", except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch. You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best. If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens. Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko. GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more. I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game. I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit ""Z"" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid. GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus. Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.","Apr 19, 2015, 11:43AM",0,"Apr 19, 2015, 11:39AM",0.85343228200371,1078,"{'num_achievements_possible': 40, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.0, 'num_achievements_attained': 0}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson,920,linusolsson,106.0,158,56.4,Z0mBi3,5,Recommended,699.0,840,103,34,1635

This game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man. You're both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay. When you slip over and land painfully on your  the other guy, completely by accident, gets his soap-stained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water. Then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though it's the other way around. You're the noob who can't get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try, the other guy in the tub is the  from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter, anti-mage, puck, ursa, or some other broken class, and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end. The guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who, even though you're farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them, insists you're killing them ""the wrong way"" and are therefore an idiot noob. The naked shower fight is also a one-way road: once you jump in, there is virtually no returning. You become enslaved and before long all you'll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won't even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don't. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust. If you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you're terrible at the game and don't consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get ""good"", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won't come back, ever. And within a month you'll find yourself just parrotting the same  people were yelling at you for earlier, because you'll be one of them by that point. And you literally will not return. You'll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language.","Apr 6, 2014, 11:51AM",0,"Apr 6, 2014, 11:27AM",0.7421875,128,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.268292682926829, 'num_achievements_possible': 41, 'num_achievements_attained': 11}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetriplehonks,95,thetriplehonks,32.0,33,22.2,"cC Chen, Honkifex Maximus",0,Not Recommended,144.0,1607,23,22,157

Where to begin... Purchased this game for the PS3, out 60 bucks, game freezes, no fix tried two copies on 3 PS3's no help from Rockstar. Waited forever with anticipation for its release on PC, preordered, postponed release, waited some more... then the day finally arrived... Oh Joy. Random crashes in single player, constant messages to reboot and reload ( if this continues contact Rockstar Support). Once in it works fine until it decides to dump to a black screen and lock up. Online.... Wow what a poor design, might work for some, but not what I expected from the ads, I cross between CrimeCraft and APB but not as good as either in any area and those games are not great. In a nutshell the City is a Lobby of sorts while you ride around and jack cars and shoot other players for no reason, or you get a call from an NPC for a PVE mission to do something random. Or you can drive to a blue icon on the map and start a mission which for the most part are just weak pvp vs instances... At this point the game becomes a ""Load Screen Simulator"" which I give a 10/10. Early experience in these games types is that you spend more time in load screens than actually playing a match. Of all that I played so far the worst was ""Crooked Cop"" it boiled down to 40 cop cars wrecked around a package with members of both teams spawning a block away each time they died and driving strait into the pile of cars... total cluster, the worst game mechanics in a multiplayer game I have experienced to date. On every level... ""Come out and Play"" really? WTF Rockstar.... why? So to sum it up I have wasted a total of 120 bucks on a game that is not worth playing. I was ""lucky"" enough to get it installed so no refund for me, or I would be clicking that button. Three installs of Social Club to fix random crashes and the inability to load the online game at all, as well as server drops where I am attempting to play Load ""Scream"" Simlulator, yes scream, not a typo - that's what we call it, we see the f'n load wheel or birds-eye city view or game tips and we scream.... So server drops, in a session with a friend, all of a sudden a spam of people leaving and I am all by myself, in a session, no friends. I have to close the game down and relaunch and wait... and wait.... only to waist more time trying to find my friend before we launch into load screens to do something stupid, then get so frustrated we quit and go do something else. Could this game be fun, yes, is it, no. Truth is its broken.

And with this horribly broken matchmaking I see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon. And because Icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the EU servers turning to s'hit because of russians, who select english on purpose because their own servers on East is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games, talking smack all the time. Now don't misunderstand, this is a great game with huge potential. But the truth of it is it's rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community. Main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows: 1# Russians ruining games, talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language. In case anyone hasn't noticed dota is a team game. 2# Solo queue has been removed(this means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone) 3# No real community Q&A support from developers, and complete ignorance on the game dev forum, mods deleting posts that's not deemed ""worthy"" even though there is issues surrounding the topics. 4# Ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal MM, the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes, It viritually means nothing when most MMR's you are still playing with complete '. 5# Broken Solo-Queue. At times, matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together, you will often or not(depending on your luck) you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game, while your team is just 2+2+1 or just all solo players. This creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match. Now Valve, has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix Dota 2's blatant community issues? Is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a non-inflammatory way? It's shameful considering how much of a profit you're making on it. At least you'd have the dignity to give us something back no? I've personally almost quit this game two times because I can't handle the community and players I am matched with constantly, they don't speak my language, share my mindset or my skill level the least, except an actual good match on some occations. Which leaves me with a horrible experience most of the time.","Dec 18, 2014, 2:06PM",2,"Jun 10, 2013, 4:39AM",0.88095238095238,42,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.375, 'num_achievements_possible': 80, 'num_achievements_attained': 30}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/dachzen,37,dachzen,22.0,5,2481.1,Yashka Sheriff,2,Not Recommended,165.0,761,0,17,196

While its beginnings were bumpy, the developers have listened to the community and are still listening, regularly making the game more enjoyable and beginner/spectator-friendly while still maintaining the integrity of the competitiveness of the game. I have high hopes that Counter Strike will be seeing a comeback in popularity. If you enjoy competitive gameplay and bettering yourself against greater opponents, you should have no doubts when choosing to buy this game. It took me over 500 hours of gameplay to get to a skill level that I feel content with (I am currently the second-highest matchmaking rank). Thanks to Global Offensive's ranking system, even a lone player can have satisfying matches in the matchmaking system and grow in skill on their own. Yes, the occasional blips happen where you're put with unreliable teammates or put against unreal opponents, but these are only opportunities to better yourself and learn what you can do as a player to increase your odds. When you do decide to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I encourage you to put your all into learning about the game and bettering yourself. Research what you can do to train your aim, what you can do to train your recoil control, and watch pro players to learn about game sense. For a game in which you often times find yourself waging the same battles at the same chokepoints, it is remarkable how every battle can be just as tense as the first one you ever participated in.

I doubt there is anyone who doesn't know of skyrim by now but i'll give you my two-cents. Skyrim is a action-RPG that plays out in a masvie open-world with thousands of side quests,things to plant/gather, and to fight. Skyrim is in a bloody Civil war between the Storm Cloaks and the Imperial army. But under the surface even more factions are fighting for turf, The Thieves guild, its glory long gone, strives to reclaim their title as masters of darkness. The Dark Brotherhood, crumbling and in despair seeks out new opportunities to return to the day when people feared them and respected them. The College of Winterhold, a old school for Mages, that fell into hard times after half of Winterhold fell into the ocean, uncovers a powerful relic that could allow Infinite wisdom or Infinite Destruction. That is just a sample of the deep story and background of skyrim. the world of skyrim IS alive and many a writer spent long hours making a amazing and life-like world. The Best part about skyrim is there is so much to do! want to be a Vampire? you can do that! want to be a werewolf and murder people? you can do that! want to kill people and eat them for dinner? guess what? you can do that! (<-- You know that is a slight bit creepy.) but really, skyrim is an open-world dream. the main storyline is fun and engaging the side quest sometimes turn into their own winding paths that take hours to complete. this makes skyrim a HUGE source of fun and gameplay. there are a few problems with Skyrim however. The game crashes often on some PCs. but some mods on the Nexus mod site will help with that. and of course with some a HUGE world there are also bugs a-glore. and with Bethseda gone off to The Elder Scrolls Online, chances are that they wont get fixed. But! the mod community has dealt with these bugs and most can be fixed by downloading the Unofficial Patch. the Steam Workshop and Nexus Mods provide an endless source of game-changing content, from new armor to flying houses to brand new branching quests. and that there is the BEST part of Skyrim on PC, The mods available explode your game-content. you play as a king of skyrim, you can marry (and kill) multiple wifes. you can get thousands of new weapons, even lightsabers! Gamers with epic gaming PCs can download the free ULTRA HD texture pack from Bethsdea themselves, and if you want to take it a step forward you can download Ultra ENBs. Skyrim Really is a different game with MODS. . some players may feel that the game is too easy. there's a mod for that. some players may feel that the cities are too empty, there's a mod for that. some players may feel like there should be more NPCs. there's a mod for that. my point is that with the MODS available on PC you really can custom your Skyrim experience to what you want,so even if you already own Skyrim on PS3 or Xbox 360, you should still pickup The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the Steam store.",,0,"Apr 2, 2014, 7:45PM",0.818181818181818,77,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.011363636363636001, 'num_achievements_possible': 88, 'num_achievements_attained': 1}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegeekofwildwood,63,thegeekofwildwood,21.0,14,149.1,Bryon Jones (In the void),4,Recommended,301.0,1743,3,17,254

You can make allies, enemies, or maybe just friends (that may or may not backstab you!) with other civilizations. You can explore the world and settle more cities to expand your civilization more, research technologies to unlock more features, make money by trading luxury resources and other stuff, and make wonders that will help your civilization in different ways. The game is also newb-friendly, as the guiders will help you grow your civilization through your first and upcoming journies. If you've played the previous Civ's, you're probably going to like Civ 5. The DLC ""Brave New World"" makes Civ 5 a whole lot better, such as it completely changes culture victories which makes it more interesting and fun overall to acomplish a Culture Victory. It adds more civilizations and wonders, and changes the way you make money by actually making you make trade routes with other civilizations or City-States to make money.

I remember I tried playing it a year ago but I sucked , so I gave up on it, even though I played for about fifteen minutes. I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking ""It can't be that bad"". After almost two months of playing, I can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. Perhaps worse. The first few weeks the liking was soft, I liked the game, the ""Meet the"" videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but I was extremely bad at first, ""15 kills, 10 deaths"" type of bad. I dominated just one player every two rounds; and I even got really excited when I got a revenge (Jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). That's how bad, and even n00by I was. I was coming back to online PC gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. But then, when I started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when I'd become friends with my pocket Medics or the people I was a pocket Medic to... Life changed. This game literally consumed me. I wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my Medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and I ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. I'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. Now it's gotten to the point in which I've played 12 hours straight of TF2 with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. With a lot of effort I got up my  to work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because I wanted to play. The game's just special like that, ya'know? It's fun.

VS. Minimum Requirement: 64bit OS Quad-Core CPU @ 2.40Ghz NVIDIA 9800 GT 1GB / AMD HD 4870 1GB (DX 10, 10.1) 4GB RAM 65 GB available space DirectX 10 compatible Soundcard These are very Low minimum Requirements, which obviously made it compelling to buy GTAV even for lower End PCs. Unfortunately this smelled like a classic ""too Good to be True"" Comparsion: Its useless to compare Performance between completely different Games. But in this case its possible to compare the performance to Max Payne 3 and GTA IV since they all run on different versions of the same Rockstar in-house engine called ""RAGE"". This is not 100% accurate by any means, it only serves as a rough guess. Max Payne 3: -Good Port -Average Fps: 50 -1080p, medium-High Settings, No AO/No AA -Looks and Runs great GTA IV: -Bad Port: -Average Fps 45 (but highly inconsistent, 15-60 fps) -1080p, medium-High Settings, No AO/No AA -Looks mediocre runs ""meh"" but more or less playable (like Ps3 with slightly better Visuals) GTA V: -Medium-Bad "" Port* "" (does vary heavily for different Set-Ups): -Average Fps around 25-30, often drops even further down with heavy non framerate related stutter -1080p, Settings all on lowest, No AO/No AA -Looks very ugly on above settings, like a ps3 version that runs unplayable bad! *Port in quotes because allegedly its supposed to be entirely developed for PC. Report: Overall: Its pretty obvious that something somewhere went terribly wrong if the PS3 Version runs and looks better than the PC Version at similar Settings. I usually refuse to play at anything lower than my native 1080p (with success btw.) But GTAV struggles even at 720p on lowest settings, varying between 25-40 fps, which is just absurd. CPU related: The Game is pretty CPU demanding. Altough i need to mention that my i5 quadcore seems to work fine most of the time. The Game multi-threads correctly, all 4 cores are at similar usage. But sometimes the Overall CPU Usage strangely skyrockets to 90-100% completely irrespective of your ingame activities. I dont know why or how, i just noticed it twice while benchmarking with HWinfo64. GPU related: Maxed out it looks definitely pretty but as soon as you start to turn down settings things fastly become surprisingly ugly, despite the silly fact that they call the lowest settings ""normal"" in the options menu. Are you used to turn Texture on high and the rest to low to get the best possible compromise? Sorry, this is not possible in GTAV... if your VRAM is anything lower than 2GB, then youre stuck at the lowest possible Texture setting which looks quite lowres and muddy. RAM related: 4GB is the minimum, period. Which, to be fair, is reasonable. Anything lower will cause a warning on launch and ultimately crashing in the Loading screen. However one issue is to be found here too, there seems to be a Memory Leak. After around 30-60min In-Game, Ram usage seems to slowly but steady climbing no matter what. 8GB Ram users are filled after around 4hours, 16GB users after ca. 8 hours. And 4GB users... well... we already start at ca. 3-4GB Usage and stay there because it obviously cant climb any further. Atleast thats my experience from the 2 Hour Test Session. Conclusion: Im deeply disappointed, they delayed this multiple times for ""optimization"" and even praised it as a 4K capable performance wonder on every opportunity but it seems like many of those were empty promises. Max Payne 3 worked so well but this simply doesnt. I know MP3 isnt an Open World Title but i was hoping that GTAV with turned down View Distance and a tad lower settings would be somewhat similar performance-wise. What annoys me the most are the deceiving Minimum Requirements. My PC exceeds the PS3 and the minimum Specs and when im looking at the Performance, its proven, that the Minimum Requirements are a blatant exaggeration of Optimism just to squeeze out as many sells as possible from financially low-grade PC owners. I would not write this review if the minimum Specs would listen DX11, 8GB RAM, GTX 550 etc. Then it would be my own fault to purchase a game that i dont have the Specs for. But thats not the Case so here it is: I do not recommend this for lower End Set-Ups. I hope this Warning does not come to late for people with similar specs. Bonus: If youre more the visual Proof kind of Guy, check out the Video below that compares the Graphic between PC Low Settings, PS3 and XB360.

Paywalling mods is not the way to go as it introduces too many complex issues into the modding community that brings no benefits to anyone other than the Valve and Bethesda's pocket filled with money. I support the idea of getting the modders paid for their hard work in enriching the games but putting a paywall is not the right way. I support donations for modders as it is fairer as everyone has different level of perceived value for something. The only scenario I support paid mods is when a mod had done exceptional work where it can be essentially a full game or an official expansion with fair amount of new content and reasonable price tag, such as Age of Empires 2's Forgotten Empires mod that became an offical expansion. I would gladly pay for exceptional mods such as C&C Generals Rise of the Reds, Dawn of War's Ultimate Apocalypse or Homeworld 2's Complex mod as these teams had outdone what the developers had done with the original game and also provided a fresh and vastly expanded experience to the game. A sword or a handful of quests in Skyrim does not provide the fresh experience like those mods mentioned above. Not to mention the absurd price that they are selling mods for which costs as much as the game itself. Valve and Bethesda, you ducked it all up. Valve really needs to get their crap together with progressively worse server connection, Greenlight flooding the market with garbage, Steam Store that acts like an annoying sales man shoving garbage at you everyday, client stability that is getting worse and non existent customer server.

Likes: -The Environment An insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of L.A. (L.S.) to near perfection. Having been to the actual city several times, I could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game. The Viper Roorm, Ripley's Believe It or Not museum, The Scientology Center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same. When the sun sets and rises, all of the lighting is accurate and at times, absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around Mt. Chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities, it's some of the best weather FX I've seen in a game because it feels real. Roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes. It truly feels like a living world. -The Satire What I feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that's so prevalent in L.A. across all social classes. The rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way, it's never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto. The signage and radio commercials are also perfect, knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself. This can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations. -The Characters There are many who dislike the characters, especially Trevor and I can see why but I liked them because of how they played off of one another. Michael, the would be retiree who's juggling family problems. Franklin, a young man growing up in the hood, doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle. Trevor, the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit, taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey. None of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they're all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them. The voice actors do an A+ job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life. -The First Person Mode Not only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made, it's also one of the best FPS's in years. Being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes. -The Radio Stations There's nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking ""We Built This City"" by Starship or ""Heartbeat"" by Don Johnson. If you like pop, rock, country, rap, trance or even talk radio, there's something here for anyone to like. Dislikes: -The Police They seem overly aggresive and I don't know if that's a play on the LAPD or not but there have been time that I've simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds. Also while in a car, I've been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot I could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me. -The Storefronts I just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but I also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world. I'd be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games. -The Sub and the Helicopter For me, the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode. The model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few. The helicopter, while fun, could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets. Thankfully Rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this. -Real Time Destruction Again, like the storefronts, I know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we'd probably be lucky to get 10-30 frames per second with Phys-X cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will. Something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments. -Extra Activities Given the sun and sand vibe of L.S.(L.A.), I wish that you could surf and skateboard. Seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth. That's not to say they couldn't add these things in a dlc pack, (fingers crossed) but I just find theior absence strange and overlooked. Those nitpicks aside, this is still one of the best games I've played in a very long time and, with so much to do, I'll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time.

Until the practice stops, I cannot recommend this game for purchase at all. Hell, not even Oblivion or Morrowind. Spend your money elsewhere and for games that encourage free modding, the same goes for dropping support for any mod authors who has the gall to put their mod up on the Workshop and/or those removing/hiding their Nexus mods.

Limited tackling (never when its needed) AI always get every second ball Terrible players can run faster than Usain Bolt Every game has the opposition score a world class goal against you from 40 yards (impossible to stop, combined with the no tackling) Your players kicking the ball out whilst trying to pass GK's animations forcing them to fail to attempt to save goals RB/LB's are useless, might as well have 9 players The AI is insane, always making perfect tackles, interceptions from across the pitch because your players try to walk to the ball, 90th min goals, 5foot 6 players out jumping a 6.5ft player None existant marking Throw in - Pass - Goal (always with the AI) No long throw tactic defence Every long ball will go to the AI team Simple catches have GK's in fits GK's rushing out and flapping GK's code has them try to catch balls on their flight paths only for the ball to go to the first man and they have an empty net Players 'walking' through other players without taking the ball No marking from passes. (5 defenders in the box, one opposition striker, he gets the ball and vollys it across goal) Players on the post wander off as soon as a corner/freekick is taken Players walk away from their markers when the ball is active Strikers (usually yours) 9/10 times in an offside position *Insert name* Didnt mean that goals are happening nearly every game Touchline team talk has NO effect to anything Players do not listen to the tactics (shooting less results in a CM player taking the same amount of shots as with it off) The graphics are pretty poor AI will kick balls through your players bodies No pressure hoof balls up the field Injuries every game Leaking goals faster than the Titanic leaked water.

Gun sway is obnoxious, optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight, the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musket-levels of pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification, you simply hear him moan incessently. The game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate DLC's which you need to buy to pilot or use. Despite the hefty price of Arma 3, you can expect the ratio price of the DLC's to be roughly 20 percent of Arma 3's original cost. The helicopter DLC, for instance, contains only two helicopters and a ""realism"" mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure. They, the creators of a military simulator, also randomly brought in a DLC that lets you race around in a go-kart. No, I don't know why either. You can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and front-grips - no one really knows why they discriminated. Not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod, edge of a window or bonnet of a car. The body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured., what weighs more, what weighs less. Many of the ""futuristic"" weapons on Arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life (AH-99 Blackfoot) or don't actually exist (such as T-100 Varsuk) making the game incredibly peculiar. It's also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require third-party software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software. The experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the game's scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point. Queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semi-conscious d1ckh3ads who can't get to the fuc king point. Buildings are only superficially destructible, they won't crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruins.Tanks can also be defeated by a farmer's three foot stonewall. Yes. And collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes. Overrall I would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space. Arma 2 including its DLC'S have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons. And whilst Arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alpha-staging in Earth's entire gaming history, Bohemia's employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance ""coincidently"" where they were basing Altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there. What the fu ck were they thinking? Ridiculous, ludicrous. Don't buy this game.

It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, ""Try your chances... Open a case."" Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

It's got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over. Everytime you play will be a different experience, may it be your role, the difficulty, or the ai. It's all different every time. You can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but it's not really game-breaking, it's just a moment you can laugh about. Plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable, There's so much different changes you can do to the game, from changing your character's voice or face, up to making a whole addon and even more. Im not gonna say the game's completely perfect though. The main problem may be the community, but from time to time you'll not meet with that problem; some people will be nice to you and help you if you're a newbie to the game, and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare, as people dont appreciate them on the servers. The gameplay; Now that is one hard question to answer. The gameplay mostly matters about you, and the gamemode, how you want to play, will still be valid, but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or you'll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while he's only using a simple rifle with no scope. As you would guess, another problem is the AI, sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes it's just the best AI you can find in a game. now, im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as it's better to find out yourselves, but i'll just say that King Of The Hill, Wasteland(mostly fun with friends), and Zeus(you'll be most likely to spend days on this one) are the ones i recommend. The community: The community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game and/or experience. I'm not gonna say much about it except this but there's alot you can say about the community. The Engine: this game requires a beefy pc(currently at its state) but the engine is brilliant, It can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard CPU usage. The engine is mostly dependant rather more on the RAM than the CPU, i recommend atleast 6-12 RAM for this game if you're gonna play it alot. Overall: The game's worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it, altough you will find mostly funny moments and non-serious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable. Certain people refer to this as a ""Walking Simulator"" but the point is that ArmA III is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms, you WILL find yourself walking and running alot to objectives, but that's how it is in real life too. The game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming. You can find alot to do in this like commanding AI and/or players, which is always hard at the start, and participating in large assaults on towns such as Kavala. In my opinion, ArmA III is worth a shot. -Lankercool, Commander and Soldier, also regular Zeus player in the ArmA III Community.","Nov 6, 2014, 5:05AM",0,"Jul 18, 2014, 3:45AM",0.8571428571428571,28,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.30000000000000004, 'num_achievements_attained': 3, 'num_achievements_possible': 10}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050908645,24,76561198050908645,8.0,4,1748.0,Lankercool,0,Recommended,229.0,164,3,2,45

But this game needs one. Let me give you five reasons why. 1st: The loading times. I have no idea why this game loads so incredibly long. I can basically get some coffee while I'm joining a session (or loading story mode, for that matter). It's not my connection and definitely not my computer. My friends have the same issues. 2nd: The netcode. Whatever they did there, they failed horribly. It's incredible how this game just sucks your internet connection dry. I can play it. But everyone who does not have a 16Mbit/s connection or a slower computer has serious lags that make the game nearly unplayable. 3rd: The stability. When the game came out, you were not able to switch back to fullscreen mode. The screen remained black and the game needed to be shut down. They fixed that one at least. I also don't get any crashes personally. BUT: I know at least three people who get them regulary, one of them is in my heist team, so we need to restart heists from time to time which sucks badly. 4th: The Social Club. Why the HELL does that garbage even exist anymore? Basically everything the Social Club does can also be done through Steam. When I want to open a party in Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2, I just invite people through Steam. So when you implement a DRM like Social Club in your game, why not just STEAM? The social features of Steam have NEVER failed me. Social Club does on a regular basis. Not only do invites not reach me often, even if they do, they are heavily delayed. But the worst part about Social Club by FAR is the security. I have no idea if it is still the case, but in the first few weeks, THOUSANDS of accounts were stolen. Hell, a friend needed nearly two weeks to get his account back (at least he did eventually), and it was not because he had a weak password, but because even HE was able to get into other people's accounts after he researched a bit on the topic! 5th: The most dickish move a publisher could actually make. We write the 11th of June. People are eagerly awating the Steam sale to buy a game which has been out on consoles for YEARS now. They don't want to pay 60 for it. Might be because they don't want to BECAUSE it is such an old game, or because they simply don't want or can spend that much money on a single game. Whatever is true, does not matter at all. They just awaited at least a -15 or -20% deal on the game as we always get during such sales. But what happens? With the start of the Steam sale, Rockstar releases ""DLCs"" that just give you in-game money you can also get through normaly doing heists. The bundle the game with one of those DLCs so the price increases to 75. But HEY, people still want their sale, right? So we do a -25 discount so the game basically matches the usual 60 price tag! People will love that, right? RIGHT? NO, they freakin' don't! And while I DID pay the full 60 when the game came out, I regretted it so much since then. And I was one of the people who defended Rockstar so much in the beginning. ""Yeees, the game is years old, BUT that does not make the gameplay worse. It also has much better graphics even than PS4 and XBone. It is even a good port this time!"" So while the story is pretty enjoyable, everything else about this game is not. It has pretty much destroyed it for me. I'm not sure if I will even finish the  story.","Jun 12, 2015, 3:47PM",0,"Jun 12, 2015, 11:33AM",0.9090909090909091,11,"{'num_achievements_possible': 50, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.2, 'num_achievements_attained': 10}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/TomTomGoLive,10,TomTomGoLive,30.0,1,44.0,[.M.I.G.] TTGL /-TPF-/ trade.tf,0,Not Recommended,94.0,18,0,2,158

Yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot, but I bought a physical copy of the DELUXE EDITION from EB and as such i expected a FINISHED GAME, not the Alpha/Beta i was confronted with. It should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. And you would think DELUXE EDITION implies that at least *some* of the DLC would be included. Nope. Not so""DELUXE"" then is it? Imagine buying a new car, and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states 'Oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard, none of the dials or switches work. But as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee'. Seems a bit rude dosen't it? paying for something and realizing it dosen't even come close to expectations. And the excuse ""why not just use mods"" is just a sad way of admiting the game isn't finished and/or it isn't any good on its own.

I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need. Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home. Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try. While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions. The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the ""follower"" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings. It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan. While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to ""find cover"" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body. Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons. Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface. Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on ""Patrol"" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process. After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take. Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.",,0,"Apr 18, 2015, 1:34AM",0.9166666666666661,24,"{'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeyStreak,22,KeyStreak,,2,319.2,--||  ||--,0,Recommended,,0,0,0,0

This could be loading screen simulator of the year when playing online, loading a simple menu = loading screen, after it loaded, the game is already full, either you choose to queue or leave = loading screen. Suddenly disconnected from crappy Rockstar servers = loading screen back to story mode, trying to go online again = loading screen (can't they happen to add a maximum waiting time, and only disconnect when time out?). The purpose of playing online, the main enjoyment out of it is to be able to play with your friends, but it is really difficult here where you have high chances losing each other when joining random online game. Can't they have a party function so all friends can be together? Yes they do have a party function but it is for the whole group of random people who have been in the room, and to leave that group and try to rejoin your friends after having losing each other is something really time consuming, and there are many loading screens waiting for you on the way of course. And after getting over all these loading screens, you will not be able to join your friends if they happen to be in a job, if everyone wants to play together, they have to quit the job = rockstar will fine them and make them a ""bad sport"" gradually for quitting. Why can't they add the feature to join while the job is in progress? People can quit the job but new people can't join, yes this is so fair Rockstar. These connection issues continue with heist missions. One player suddenly disconnected thanks to Rockstar awesome server = everyone failed, I spent 2 hours just to wait and invite people to a heist mission in which when we were about to finish, a heist member randomly left (yes because of Rockstar server), only 10 meters away from the finish mark and we saw all our work of the last 10 game time minutes got dumped into the sea. And like 99% of the time joining a heist you have to watch the cutscene over and over again because all 4 heisters have to completed it as a leader before being able to skip it. What if someone is so frustrated with R server or just only like to play as a crew member? Doing heist is really a pain in the neck not because it's difficult but because Rockstar server is so good at making people's game more difficult, and it is so rage inducing. The game design forcibly requires 4 people to do heist, well, I'm really really fine with bots, stupid bots are ok but just don't die please. Yet Rockstar force me to play with people and on the other hand they suck at letting me to. And random people joining you will most of the time just do stupid thing and die. I can actually do all the heist mission alone, if there is ever any bot, I don't need random people to make my game harder. The online game is great but the raging, the frustration makers it packed in equally destroy all the experience. It is like R made a really good meal for you but you just can't eat it, the moment when you can taste it is awesome, but most of the time R server will keep you out of this delicious meal, making you dying to taste it.",,0,"May 4, 2015, 2:42AM",0.8,15,"{'num_achievements_possible': 10, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.9, 'num_achievements_attained': 9}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/thanhnguyen1911,12,thanhnguyen1911,14.0,3,380.0,Thnh,0,Not Recommended,42.0,330,4,8,536

When this game was first released, it was still unfinished. There were many bugs and issues, some of which made playing the game difficult to say the least; However, it was still one of the best games of 2011. Over the years, these issues have largely been addressed and the game is now more stable. The visuals in Skyrim were stunning, absolutely stunning, when compared with it's predecessor, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, released Six-years earlier. Using the then new Creation Engine, Skyrim is a hyper-realistic world for the player to explore much like Morrowwind, with a size similar to Cryodill in Oblivion. Skyrim has several DLC packs, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn all of which are a part of the Legendary Edition. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is a game every RPG gamer should have in their library. Most of the bugs and issues, present when the game was first released have been resolved. There is also a library of Mod's available for Skyrim if you know where to look to personalize the game the way you want it. If you enjoyed Oblivion, you should also enjoy Skyrim, as it has a more realistic world design from Oblivion, though is similar in actual overall size. ~Potential Spoilers~ Skyrim, takes place 200 years after the events of Oblivion, in the Northern Lands of Skyrim on Tamriel. You play as the Dragonborne, someone who has the ability to absorb the souls of a Dragon and call upon the magical ability, Thu'um, known as the Shout of the Dragon.

That game blew me away when I first played it. I honestly thought the freedom it offered you was an illusion and that the game would spontaniously end. But it never did, and I kept playing it over and over again. Nowadays sandbox games are a dime a dozen, but Rockstar has remained top dog in the fight since the PS2. Why? Unlike Volition who make excuses as to why they couldn't provide features everyone liked, Rockstar takes risks and gives you things you never thought you wanted. GTA5 takes place in Los Santos, which was previously featured in GTA San Andreas. Los Santos by far is the most detailed single location in the entire series. The game features things like industrial ghettos, vast mountains with wilderness, and expansive oceans you can swim through and uncover secrets while dodging sharks. It lets you seamlessly switch between three protagonists who are not only just as detailed as any of the previous ones, but are also completely distinguishable from each one with individual sidequests and unique gameplay modes. GTA5 looks great, plays great, feels distinctive and most importantly took risks that paid off immensly. In a world of botched launches, underwhelming overhyped titles and a desire for a game the developers actually cared about making. GTA5 goes above and beyond the call of duty. It is hard to describe any one flaw with this game without comparing the 2000 things it does well.

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate. The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.","Apr 30, 2014, 9:52AM",0,"Nov 25, 2013, 2:01PM",0.8862696443341601,2418,"{'num_achievements_attained': 32, 'num_achievements_possible': 84, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.38095238095238004}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornyKelleher,2143,CornyKelleher,24.0,275,118.7,Corny Kelleher,0,Recommended,15.0,868,18,4,362

I wrote something for real! These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think!

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale. I'm just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics.","Jun 14, 2015, 12:25PM",0,"Jun 11, 2015, 11:29AM",0.8550698016164581,5444,"{'num_achievements_possible': 10, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.9, 'num_achievements_attained': 9}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/JerichoVictorNocte,4655,JerichoVictorNocte,33.0,789,74.8,[S|B] Jericho VioletSkyy,0,Not Recommended,38.0,96,55,2,110

It's updated from time to time, it doesn't feel abandoned like most multiplayers and it has a large pool of creative fans. Plus custom game mods like Slender Fortress, Freak Fortress and Death Run make the game twice as better. So I'll just point out the negatives. Explosive spam. It is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way. Kudos Short Circuit. It was fun while it lasted. Crutch weapons/shields and overall annoyance. Black Box/Concheror. Darwin's Shield. Reserve Shooter. Beggar's Bazooka. Vaccinator pairs. Degreaser combos. Despite naming these, I bet all of us use them anyway. So I guess you should all feel horrible about yourselves. Mini-sentries. It sets up in less than 3 seconds. The engineer has the ability to pick up his gear; why not force him to ulitize a push with his teammates instead? It's a server killer. When you're on a team that doesn't feel like destroying them constantly, it's dead. Melee system. You may run into some issues with hit registration not going your way, like hearing your melee weapon make it's hit sound, but no actual registration. Pocket medics. This can go both ways and it's understandable to heal just that one power class that's getting most of the dirty work done. We get it. But what you don't get is that you're gaining much assistance as well from the rest of your teammates that is providing much said and needed push. Do the team a favour. Heal everyone (at least those who respect you). People not understanding the difference between Boot Camp and Mann Up mode. The essence of Mann Up mode is to use the most effective loadouts, have a organized team of each class and to get through wave by wave. If you want to mess around, there is Boot Camp. Lag compensation. This takes the cake. Shots will seem off and you'll most definitely have those moments where you either got sniped through a wall or railed through the wall by the Heavy's curving mini-gun bullets. You thought you got past that wall, but you didn't on their screen. Seeing as I play Scout, it's something I notice on a daily basis, specifically against heavies. It's just all lag compensation. Curious to know more about it, I recommend googling it. Critical hits. It's either you get lucky or outlucked. If it's a issue for players, you'll have to search for those servers that host non-crit settings as the known popular public servers don't. There can be humor in it, but not when it's so frequent. Either way, critical hits are random pokes of not fun and it ruin the results of good matches. Servers not tolerating class balance. Not everyone wants to play in a server infested with engineers and mini-sentries/sentries all over the place. Or more than 2-3 demomen spamming stickies everywhere. Whatever the scenario is, this slides right into lack of teamwork and coordination. Things may never get done the right way, so your best bet is to probably just find another server. Try to get a fair team scramble going and all of the average to good players may quickly go to spectator mode to restack again. We are no angels to that. Who doesn't want to be on the better team? Closing comments... Although all of that is what's to dislike about TF2, you'll somehow just find a way to see pass through it all and enjoy the game for what it is.

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate. The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.","Apr 30, 2014, 9:52AM",0,"Nov 25, 2013, 2:01PM",0.8862696443341601,2418,"{'num_achievements_attained': 32, 'num_achievements_possible': 84, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.38095238095238004}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornyKelleher,2143,CornyKelleher,24.0,275,118.7,Corny Kelleher,0,Recommended,15.0,871,18,6,362

Example... you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day. You can try to teach a player a new move or position; and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent. You will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and non-impactful. Oh and did I mention that some of the User Interface is completely bugged? And I mean completely! Try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options *do not appear*.

He chose snowball heroes his MMR rose, there was a certain joy in his victories no matter how badly his team did. Then after long nights of 1v5 he thought to himself ""I wonder how it would be if i played with those other four russians"" For a week he tried to help lead others into the light of smart plays, excelent ward placement, and proper item choices. He led by example keeping the games close through the mid-game. But when the late game struck and the enemies BKBs were built, the team he spent the past thirty minutes of his life guiding and supporting were not there. They were not there when the bottom rax fell, they were not there when the ward spotted the Radiant attempt on roshan's life, they were not there when the mid rax was taken, they were farming, chasing illusions and supports. When the time came. When the last set of rax seemed doomed to fall, they came. In came my four hard carries like the lost children of a single mother they came to defend my home from the void. They had spent so much time farming and leaving the fighting to me that they hadnt a clue how to fight together. the four of them died a horrible death, only killing a crystal maiden they saw on their way back to the base...

Without it, it's bland and not very interesting, with an awful story, uninspired gameplay and tons of unfixed bugs. Still a decent game if you like exploration, but that's really all that game has going for it. And now Bethesda moves to a new business model, making people pay for mods, with potentially future games allowing only paid mods, which means we'll have to pay for bugfixes and additions to the games, without any guarantee that it will work or any accountability from the developers for these paid features developed by amateurs. Therefore, I can't recommand this game or any future Bethesda game anymore, at least until we see how the future games are handled in that aspect. It was fun while it lasted. Farewell for now Bethesda. Edit: well, looks like all that agitation had a result, Valve and Bethesda backpedaled and paid mods are gone. It will take a bit of time for trust to rebuild though, so in the meantime my review stays negative. No need to change it if Bethesda tries another boneheaded move tomorrow or the next month. Edit 2: lol, a bunch of idiotic fanboys went through all my reviews and downvoted them all to avenge their beloved Skyrim. ""This guy made a negative review of Skyrim for reasons we don't agree with, let's downvote all his positive reviews for games that have nothing to do with Skyrim.""

The mod community has always been something that went part and parcel with the games themselves. Even I have designed mods for Oblivion and Morrowind, and it was great fun to be a part of it. Skyrim lacks this free and open access to modding. Which is a shame. Because without free and open access the game suffers substantially. In addition to graphical and error improvements, there were literally thousands of small tweaks you could enjoy with Elder Scrolls that do not continue in the same way for Skyrim.

We shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy. This went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in ""dibs"", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened. In order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies. Babylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders. I offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted. North of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome. While they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon. I had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them. My civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall. Eventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world. They all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway. Democracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful).

Just too many issues (and it appears I'm not the only one), to mention in one review so I will list my biggest bugbears; - Injuries - like many others, each save game has been dominated with injuries (FM (Liverpool), FMC (Liverpool), FM (custom)). Of course many players get injured but I have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 2/3 reserve and youth players. This means on average i have about 8 senior players injured (6-8 weeks is the most common length) - Training - there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things. It is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one (for example - attacking training). There is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes. Why would i want the likes of Skrtel, Toure and Sakho doing Attacking training the majority of the time? It is just lazy game designing. On top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload - no matter what you try to fix it. - Talking to players - again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side. You only have the same options available. Sure you can try to ""convince"" players but only with intangible promises. - e.g promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player - Everything is short term - ""this is my plan for this season"" - Most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan. You should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety - e.g have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop, or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc - teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees - it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out. -tactics are inflexible - rarely does it work if you want to play a fast, short game. Or a slow, direct game. This is nothing like real life, remember Liverpool last season? Or Stoke every season? plus they still haven't brought back player runs - a huge miss for tactical control. The biggest problem? Matchday - I watch it on 2D to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist. The two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of all......Opponent takes a shot, kepper makes a save, ball comes back into the penalty box, keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the net......funny thing is it only happens to your keeper. Plus the tactics you use don't have a big effect on the game. I tested this out by doing the old save/restart cheat against West Brom at home. (Tried 442,451,433 with different player combinations and tactics......each time lost 2-1 or 2-0 On the plus side it looks prettier. Unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for Miles and the SI team to make real improvements. Each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return. At least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before it's official release date. If you would like to play alternative manager games i recommend FM11 and Premier manager 97, those games felt like the developers cared",,0,"Dec 24, 2014, 11:33AM",0.804195804195804,286,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050674374,230,76561198050674374,,56,422.1,dariusx10,0,Not Recommended,,0,4,0,0

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business.

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... ""Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds."" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most ""mature"" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a ""pay-to-win game"" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.","Jul 7, 2015, 5:00PM",3,"May 7, 2015, 4:18PM",0.9265734265734261,858,"{'num_achievements_possible': 518, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.596525096525096, 'num_achievements_attained': 309}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi,795,emperorgandhi,17.0,63,930.5,[CotC] King Conga Gandhi,3,Recommended,266.0,1278,26,42,123

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.",,6,"Jun 14, 2014, 4:32PM",0.8982916170043701,2517,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.6227544910179641, 'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_attained': 104}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112775620,2261,76561198112775620,12.0,256,92.5,Dovah,0,Recommended,124.0,125,60,3,64

The graphics are pretty awesome as well. I fully intend to play this game a lot, and as I don't intend to use mods the whole banning people for mods thing (though stupid) doesn't affect me. There is, however, one major problem that makes the game almost unplayable. The graphics are great, until I get in a car at high speeds or car accidents. They become choppy, no matter what I set the graphics to... It will be fine one second, then it practically becomes a powerpoint presentation for a moment, then catches up with itself. This makes literally any time you drive a horrible experience. Given how much driving there is in this game, that's a problem. Steam will say you have played ""5 hours"" of the game... In reality, it's been more like 3 hours of gameplay and 2 hours of intermitent tinkering with setting to try and fix the problem. I figured maybe my computer just sucked, but I looked online and I am apparently not the only one having this problem. Even people with ultra high end PCs built for smooth gaming are having this problem. Until they fix it, I would not recommend anyone buy this game. Once the problem is gone, yeah, even for $60 the game would be worth it.","Jul 14, 2015, 1:02AM",0,"May 9, 2015, 10:28PM",0.5625,16,"{'num_achievements_possible': 60, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.23333333333333303, 'num_achievements_attained': 14}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Peblz,9,Peblz,12.0,7,98.9,Omega156,0,Not Recommended,17.0,1,0,4,234

Created by Hidden Path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 1.6, cscz and css. This is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of COD and Battlefield generation. You see CS generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled. You'd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the fore-mentioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer. How have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference. The newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined CQC mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bomb/defuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with. For me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if youre an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes. The inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the Molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics. Most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps, game types and weapon skins to name but a few. There is the introduction of operation payback whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play. So why would you choose this over css for the experienced player. I find that it adheres to the original 1.6 far more closely then css ever did. The aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely. There are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though, such as spectator mode, competition spectators i.e. Dreamhack, newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few. For me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode. Ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ED, played pcws or cups. Now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out. These include dropped players being replaced by bots, hacking and over watch submissions, uneven rank matches to name but a few. If you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me.","Dec 15, 2013, 2:14PM",0,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:07PM",0.695652173913043,23,"{'num_achievements_possible': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_attained': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/venomjackal,16,venomjackal,,7,964.6,-=[PAK]=- VeNoM JaCKaL,0,Recommended,,0,1,0,0

In vanilla there is only a basic (and I mean basic) ""bullet drop"" system no realistic ballistics whatsoever without the use of mods, you could literally be in one of the biggest thunderstorms the game could throw at you with gales, rain and all the other lovely things and you will still be able to drop a target at close to a mile away with a precise headshot, simply by pointing up a bit..... There are quite literally dozens of examples of how this game is not realistic, here's just a few. - Vehicle behaviour - is a joke, choppers have been updated in the choppers DLC to be more realistic but even then that means you have 2 completely different flight models for vanilla choppers vs. vanilla jets, obviously they are different one is a chopper the other is a fixed wing jet but here's what I mean, choppers now take into account wind speed, direction, variable gusts, as well as reaction forces, mostly to do with real world physics and all manner of other things whereas the jets simply don't, they feel like they are on rails there is no real skill involded (unless dogfighting) in flying them. Ground vehicles are just as bad there was a more 'realistic' driving model in the original grand theft auto. And that is the nicest thing I could say about it. - Low res vs. high res players - This admittedly is a multiplayer pvp issue so wont affect pve or sp gameplay but ill try to explain it, In pvp (if you play pvp) you will notice your getting sniped even though your behind a bush or shot through a fence or something similar, this is because 'low res' players cant see these details because it is too far away and not yet 'drawn' for them, but they can see you, This is because the draw distance for a character is permanent and un-changeable (it does change but cant be changed by the player, without mods) whereas the detail draw can be changed through changing settings this is in case you wish to improve performance, but this inherently means if you play pvp you have to play with everything turned down just to be on a level playing field. Not very realistic is it? - 3rd vs 1st person in pvp multiplayer, 3rd person players can see around corners, over walls etc, whereas 1st person players cant making 1st person in pvp pointless, nothing more to say. - Player animation - This is the thing that really bugs me to the point I have rage quit in the past, in what possible universe would a person have to stand still in a firefight just to change weapons? There are other animations I detest but that one gets me the most. Note - this can be fixed with mods. - AI behaviour - The AI in this game is a joke, and not a funny one, they are like headless chickens running around with guns shooting at sounds, for example I was playing a game with friends the other night when our pilot was one shotted at over 300m (altitude) from an AI enemy with a bog standard Katiba (which is based on a Khaybar) with its skill setting turned down to 45/100, not only was this ridiculous it is also unrealistic, I have fired assault weapons IRL (not a Khaybar ... Unfortunately) but I can tell you now there is no way in the entirety of the road to hell could you possibly one shot a pilot in a chopper in the sky flying over 300m at over 80mph with any kind of assault weapon, only with a powerful rifle would you even have a chance and even then the shot must be spectacular and ideally head on to the chopper, what have I learned from this... There is no ballistic shielding simulated in vanilla choppers either in its hull (which would be around the cockpit and gunner positions) or in the cockpit glass and if it is, it is in desperate need of an update. I simply refuse to mention AI pilots because they are dead, I killed them all for their incompetence. OK I know by now your sick of me bashing this beloved game, but that's the thing I LOVE this game and like many others I have had hours upon hours of fun playing this, but I cannot get past the fact that this game is so unpolished and so poorly optimised it really does feel like a badly made console port and i genuinely feel the same anger i had with GTA IV way back when the PC version was first released, the random lag or crashing in the middle of the action because the game cant cope with what's going on and just cries in the corner while all the other games just point and laugh at it, the reason i portray it that way is because it feels like Bohemia is dragging its heels and then when it finally has something to give us it overprices it in what is an apparent need for funds which lets be honest makes them look a bit needy - i can understand that though, they need money to pay the staff, but what i don't understand is why they give us so little for our money compared to the like of the arma 2 dlc's in which we got factions, vehicles, soldiers, weapons and missions all in one DLC package i know the price was higher, but for an example Arma 3: Helicopters DLC you pay now 08/05/2015 is 10.99 GBP or $16.95 USD i think.... Anyway what your paying for is the privileged honour of being able to pilot 2 helicopters, that's it, you get everything else for free in an update including the ability to travel in the helicopters, well i suppose that's good right? Wrong basically they tried to tell us this was some kind of great thing they did for us but in actual fact it was so that it didn't split the playerbase, basically covering themselves from flaming on that aspect but i suppose that means most of the people that bought it are going to be decent pilots, not all but most, yes? Well yes actually, most of the pilots i have flown with flying the dlc choppers are good probably about 70% of time, but that means all the really bad pilots vive had in the past all got better at flying? Or does this mean only the people who bought the DLC were the really good pilots with a few people with spare cash thrown in, but if this is the case then Bohemia managed to miss out on a massive cash injection by not putting more choppers into the pack maybe even a custom air force faction for NATO and CSAT its only retexturing some uniforms and some code, its hardly rocket science it takes time sure but still 2 choppers? Its an insult, i just downloaded a mod which gave me 4 choppers and 7 planes with a custom faction, uniforms, soldiers, equipment etc, it took all of 40 seconds to download and hey guess what i didn't spend a penny. Ok this got way too long way too fast so here, conclusion is this i want to recommend this game because i have had a lot of good memories with it and im sure others will like it as well but at the same time i cannot recommend this game for all its flaws, If your willing to put serious time into modding this game then yes buy it, but as i said i cant recommend this because of it flaws and because of the company behind it, i have lost faith in it and cant recommend you buy this.

When I first heard of Skyrim coming out later that year, I wasn't thrilled at all. Having played Oblivion briefly in the past, and not being convinced at all, Skyrim became the most over-hyped game I could think of. When it eventually went on the shelves and I had a few glances at the Let's Plays that popped up all over YouTube, I looked at it in sheer disbelief. It looked awful, very awkwardly wet textures, that was one of my main issues (honestly!). I decided, however, and that was after the initial euphoria with the gaming community had died down a bit during the frosty nights of early January of 2012, I might give it a go, once a legit price drop had occurred and the big hype had completely dispersed. So then, in April of 2012 I finally ordered a retail copy from the UK. I had ordered it together with a dear friend of mine, that regularly orders games from the UK (on account that they are much cheaper there than in Germany), and he encouraged me to boot it up. I had a good time with it, but it was, well, just good. I had tried a few mods from the Steam Workshop for my first time playing, mainly the HD Texture Pack and a few other minor tweaks. I continued to play the game and eventually I became aware of the much larger modding community of the Nexus Pages. And this is where my interest in the game finally sparked immensely. Modding became more of a challenge and I needed help. This help came in the form of Gopher's modding guides. Gopher offered a variety of concise and easy to follow guides to modding games on his Youtube Channel, as well as, and that was the gist of it all a very entertaining series of Let's Plays of Skyrim. His play style is somewhat different to what I had had in the past, but it so verily applied to how I feel about games in general. Games are the perfect medium of literary immersion. A game can engage you on so many more levels than a book or a film can ever dare to. And that is exactly why Skyrim eventually became such a dear game to me. Skyrim is a game that rewards engagement in its lore. It can become so lively, so intricately designed, but only if the player is willing to go further than bluntly playing the game. It is a living, breathing world with a back story so rich, that one can not ever learn all of it. I myself regularly lose myself reading through the articles on the Elder Scrolls Wiki Pages, stepping from one topic into the next. The Story of Skyrim is very iconic in the way that it is written. Joseph Campbell's ""monomyth"" or ""The Hero's Journey"" in which the Protagonist is called from his normal life to adventure, on a quest to save the world. There are obstacles along the way, wise teachers and climactic action. The Monomyth is a pattern that works well and it does so in Skyrim too. The internal development of the Dragonborn hero however, is up to the imagination of the player, and this is where immersion comes into play again. If you are not willing to immerse yourself in the game and identify with the Dragonborn, the game will have no lasting value to you. The gameplay also intrigued me. Having slight prior experience with RPGs I have touched the basics of typical RPG game play. Skyrim however stands out from the crowd by making levelling an organic process. You swing a sword at an enemy - you get better at sword fighting; you get hit - your experience with armour increases; you mix ingredients together - you learn their effects and become better at creating potions. This process, this ""learning-by-doing"" feels very natural, very logical. Much more so than the typical RPG practice of gaining experience through completing quests or fights and then choosing yourself what you want to become better at. Another great implication of this levelling model is that it essentially resolves the issue of class-restrictions. You can be whoever you want to be: you can be a heavily armoured mage, you can be a lightly armoured, two-handed weapon wielding killing machine, you can combine magic and one-handed weaponry, and, most importantly, you are allowed to do all of them at once if you choose to. The Combat itself runs in real time, like its predecessors, and there is no automatic hit-and-miss calculation involved like it was the case in Morrowind for example, ergo, you hit - you hit, you miss - you miss; an action-style combat system. However, and this is a big however, there is no locational hit detection, so that head shots or blows to specific body parts on enemies generally have no different effect from hitting any other body part. This is made up by the fact that certain perks add chances of critical damage to their respective weapon types. The world design of Skyrim at times is stunningly beautiful, awe-inspiring vistas, gloomy caves and warm, inviting inns. And then there are times, when everything looks a bit dull. This is owed to the fact that Skyrim is such a resource heavy game, that in the development Bethesda had to work with a lot of ambient lighting which is not always practical and doesn't look very good. Vanilla (modder's jargon for ""the unmodded game"") Skyrim, therefore suffers a few drawbacks in regards to its looks. And so, we come to my final argument. This argument may be the strongest of all, because it might eliminate all of the issues that I have with the game. It is the moddabilty. Through the use of mods, that can also be created by the player itself using the free Creation Kit that came with the copies of the game, every mistake, every bug, every minute inadequacy can be remedied. If you don't like the look of something, you can mod it. If you don't like the way something works, you can mod it. If you feel something is missing from the game or something it is need of, you can mod it in. If something is broken, you can fix it with mods. Modding can add to the game in such a grand way, it can change your experience entirely, or it can just enhance it. And it can make Skyrim play the way you want. This is what ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" is all about: player choice. If you will, you can play it for a couple of hours and then never touch it again. But if you are willing to engage yourself further, there is so much more you can do with it. It can become your very own epic poem.","Jun 30, 2014, 5:00PM",0,"Jun 30, 2014, 10:43AM",0.871794871794871,39,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.33333333333333304, 'num_achievements_possible': 51, 'num_achievements_attained': 17}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/MnNwr,34,MnNwr,13.0,5,764.1,Der Munger,0,Recommended,44.0,207,2,3,107

I got to say that till now I had not finish the story as there are so much more to do. I was pleasantly surprised initially when I see people with over 2000~4000+ hours of gameplay time. All I can say is Skyrim had just that much content especially if you include all the DLCS. I mean just building a single house took me more than 2 hours, not to mention the fact that I had to design and decorate my own house. It pretty much a chore that feel great after you are done with it. I am also barely done exploring Skyrim after 90 hours in, the combat are extremely fluid and animated especially when you do a sneak attack. There are many other great elements in Skyrim such as pick-locking which can be extremely frustrating but fun to play around with. I had never been this impressed with a RPG before and I definitely think Skyrim is by far the best I had played so far for this price.

Some people eject you out from car while you're driving on a normal high speed. Some people spawn disgusting things in front of you. Some people bomb you as soon as you walk out from house. Some people still kill you even if you're in passive mode. Some people use certain way to shoot you with minigun, after dying you'll be surprised to find your ammo are 0, pay $200,000 for ammo!

Once in every two or three hours I (and my friends) are heaving a memory leak and game freezes (like 0.1 fps) until restart. I am using a laptop with two videocards so each time I start launcher it crashes unless I turn one of videocards off while it loads. It is rather annoying. Optimization itself is pretty fine, I wasn't sure that my laptop will handle this game but it does. And speaking about actual game aside of these memory leaks and various issues with starting up the game - its grate. I had little faith in GTA series after IV being a boring trash, but GTAV learned on the mistakes of the previous chapter. Characters are more original and charismatic. Unlike in GTAIV where you had to do 5 missions between every ""story"" mission, each task in GTAV makes sense and does not feel boring at all. Downsides in GTA Online: Dozens of glitches and bugs that are both annoying and even game breaking. But what is most important (and frustrating) is loading times and amount of these said loading times. After almost every action you have to stare at the loading screen (from 15 to 60 seconds). Example 1 (Remember, like I said - each loading is bout 30 seconds): Join online -> loading -> failed to connect -> loading -> Join online -> loading -> Joined, but friends are in another ""world"" -> First option: Join friends -> loading -> A lot of players in here, do you want to wait in Queue? -> No -> Loading Second option: Join friends -> Do you want to wait in queue? -> Ok, fine! -> Loading -> You spawn in some game world that is different from your first one, for a duration of queue -> Loading -> Joined friends Example 2 Join heist -> loading -> joined heist, lobby leader is starting the heist in 10 seconds -> one of party members left the lobby -> disconnecting -> loading Example 3: Join random heist/job -> loading -> You don't want to do that particualr thing -> leave -> loading","Apr 19, 2015, 4:50PM",0,"Apr 15, 2015, 3:32PM",0.6153846153846151,13,"{'num_achievements_possible': 20, 'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0, 'num_achievements_attained': 20}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/slavedemorto,8,slavedemorto,63.0,5,104.7,SlaveDeMorto,0,Recommended,317.0,88,1,29,536

I and many other people have been waiting for years for this game and have bought this game numerous times over to play it on other systems and one of the main reason I got it for PC even (the third time) was to be able to MOD IT!!! you know it's bad enough you had the audacity to wait two god damn years to release the PC version of this game and still ask for 60 bucks on top of it but now you're punishing the PC community for modding the singleplayer? you knew the moment this game hit the virtual shelves on steam this game was going to be modded to the holy hell because of how long we been waited for it and you're punishing us? I call b*llsh*t and you should be a damn shame yourself!!! we're not hurting the game or ruining anyone else's experience with GTA5 and you shouldn't be banning us for modding your 2 year old game!!! you know what's really funny Rockstar? is that if I had pirated your game besides spending my hard-earned money on it I could still technically be playing it right now with all the mods and not have to worry whatsoever about getting banned and i would still have money left over but I didn't cuz I wanted to show you my support and buy this game... again... thanks for showing the love to the people who actually spend their hard earn money on your game, I'll make sure this is the last Rockstar product I actually buy until you guys get your sh*t together... this is a great game but saddly i can no longer recommend it with what's going on... (original review) well it's finally here, after almost 2 long years GTA 5 is finally on PC. I've played this game on both my xbox 360 and Xbox one and now finally on my PC. I will admit that I'm still a bit salty with rockstar for delaying the PC version of this game for so long after its initial console release but I gotta say they did one hell of a good job optimizing this game for PC, this game runs great and has more graphic settings then alot of PC exclusive games. the keyboard and mouse controls feel great and even driving on keyboard feels good. I think it's fair to say that this has to be rockstars best PC launch yet, but on the other hand that's was to be expected with how many delays this game has gotten... but anyway with that being said let's move on to the game play aspect. GTA V with no question has one of the most diverse open world maps I've ever seen, this world is HUGE and it feels like a real living place. I've been playing this game for almost two years now and to this day sometimes I still find new places I haven't seen before in the game. the gameplay has been redefined from the last GTA and feels alot more natural and fluent, it even has a very well done tacked on FPS mode so you can experience the game in a whole different perspective, in a way it makes it feel like an entirely different game. the story is very fun and very compelling and can even be touchy at times and is a reflection of how messed up modern day society can be. there is a ton of side ejectives to do in the single-player and playing GTA online with friends is an absolute blast. this has been said to death but I'll say it again, even with all the delays this game has had it is still a masterpiece. I can highly recommend this game to almost anyone. it just goes to show what can happen when developer put actual time and effort into their games. all i got to say is ""Rockstar Games, way to not f*** it up"" xD lol Overall Score: (9/10) Incredible ;3",,0,"May 6, 2015, 6:38PM",0.642857142857142,14,"{'num_achievements_possible': 45, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.5777777777777771, 'num_achievements_attained': 26}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamestheraccoon,9,jamestheraccoon,21.0,5,29.3,XZMB3XEPICRACCOON,0,Not Recommended,15.0,1902,0,14,93

Over the years the gameplay of the game has changed, valve keeps doing small changes everytime, combining those changes the gameplay experience is not the same in my opinion, i think the game was more fun and attractive when i played the game for the 1st time, small changes like not being able to take your buildings in you hand to the spawn, the distinction between the rocket launcher and the rocket jumper, small changes to weapons... made me abandon most of the competitive gamemodes from valve. The only valve gamemode that sometimes i play is MvM and it is getting more bugged whenever a big update is released and its matching system sucks.

Longer Review: While I did enjoy GTA, I believe it makes a great example for how flawed the Steam review system is, this game is not bad enough for me to ""dislike"" but in no way good enough to recommend. Both Single Player and Multi Player boast with a huge world filled with different activities for you to explore. And, especially in GTA: Online, you will find races, missions and of course the heists scattered around the map. Yet, somehow the world manages to still feel empty to me, when playing a game called ""Grand Theft Auto"" the last thing I want is all the deathmatch nonsense I find around the map, most missions are too simple to be truly as good as the single player, and thus they bleak in comparison. The races can be fun when they are made by the community or if they generally include crazy jumps and stunts. But most races (especially air races) will end up being won by the person that started first. So? What can you do in GTA: Online? The answer is simple, not much, while I had a lot of fun with a few of the races, I spent mos of my time buying clothes, modding my cars, getting tattoos and of course, doing the much anticipated Heists. That was the most fun part of the MP as they had some form of ""story"" coming with some well made cutscenes and good dialogue (if you can call it that) that made them compelling. And, even the actual gameplay, the killing, driving, flying, etc. worked well in that context. It was fun, or it would have been, but I'll come to the negatives later. OK, we talked about the MP, how was the SP though? Fun, honestly, even though I had basically no choice when it comes to customizing the characters, Michael, Trevor and Franklin, it didn't make the mistakes Online did, providing the player with a lot of fun main and side missions, the story wasn't too cliche even though a lot of the gameplay seemed like it was intended as a tutorial for the MP. Last, but not least, the world (SP and MP), was beautiful, the landscapes, the night sky, all of it was breathtaking. So much in fact that I once went to the beach just for the sake of swimming. So, until now it seems like a fine game, why the thumb down? GTA has problems, major problems, despite being originally released two years ago. First off, the lack of content, I already touched on that before, but again I have to say that most of the stuff you can do is kinda boring, and in both SP and MP heist set up missions are basically mundane tasks. Speaking of heists, you remember when they said that the player could choose how to proceed? Yup, totes true, in SP. And, let's not forget that the choices are ALWAYS binary. Seriously, the Heists could be fun if you didn't have to replay every setup mission 1000x because of either bad teammates, connection or some other silly thing that has nothing to do with the actual game. Also, the stock market is a terrible feature that is tied to missions and will essentially only be of any benefit when in that context. What else? Well the progression system is quite bad. I'm rank 20 something and I'm almost done with everything I want to do in that game, too bad one of those things is to get a minigun (a fun weapon I have to admit) that I can only get when I'm LVL 120. Yup, have fun doing only races for three months do achieve that. But the worst part is the car mod progression, of which some is not tied to rank. As I mentioned, I like tuning cars, well, you HAVE to do races for that. Again, have fun with that if you don't like racing. But the greatest of all problems are still the bugs, performance, connectivity issues and more, oh you finally found a session? Whoops, to bad, we lost connection. People unable to get into cars because of sudden lag, people ONLY starting to lag when in cars with other, crashing, that one guy that is level 12000 and thus has four times more life than me (great game mechanic) that is in the same session. Why? Why don't they just have a server browser? And, of course the most recent bug I have experienced, and also the most recent one, in fact it's the reason that I'm writing this review (bias much?), is the one that locked me outside my account. Yup, can't login. GG Rockstar, well played. To conclude: Pros: +GREAT world and graphics. +Fun even if a little dull Single Player in general. +Good dialogue and filmography when they actually show it off. +Tuning is alot of fun. +Gameplay is overall solid. Cons: -Lack of content, what IS there is dull. -Bugs, crashes, glitches, etc -Problematic progression system.(still somewhat rewarding to get new stuff) -Overall the high expectations were not met. A great game that is sadly dragged down by a few bad design choices and it's bad bad state. Best treated like an early access game, get it once they have actually worked on it. Fun, but not good. Edit(Stuff I forgot, etc): 1) Turns out you can invest in the stock market and make a profit by robbing someone and investing in that stores competitors. Only works in SP. 2) You do not make enough money in MP. Heists are the only thing that make a lot of money. It still only allows for very little considering the work you put into them. 3)Game crashes when accessing the GTA:V creator from Online.","May 11, 2015, 11:23AM",7,"May 7, 2015, 1:52PM",0.611111111111111,18,"{'num_achievements_possible': 167, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.6886227544910181, 'num_achievements_attained': 115}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/andgeo,11,andgeo,22.0,7,105.8,AndGeo[On VACation],7,Not Recommended,23.0,28,0,24,127

If that's our standard for goodness... then no wonder this country's screwed."" - Michael De Santa STORY (No Spoilers) Grand Theft Auto V pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists: Michael, a married man suffering from a midlife crisis, Franklin, a gangster trying to make a change for himself, and Trevor, who's just a Canadian psychopath. The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades. The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on. When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dogChop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)! GTA ONLINE: The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance. After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy). There are multiple game modes in Online, including: Free Roam - Run around with up to 32 of your closest friends (or enemies), causing chaos and other nonsense. You can also compete in mini-games, such as target practice, arm wrestling, golf, and tennis. If you don't like to be killed constantly by other players in Free Roam, you can play in Solo Mode, but you'll be unable to play game modes that require more than one player. Missions - These are given out by characters in GTAV (Lamar, Gerald, Martin, etc.), and are co-op jobs with up to 4 players. Survival - Try to survive up to ten waves of enemies with 3 other players. PVP - There are multiple subsets of this, including: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch (Free for all), Vehicle Deathmatch, Team Elimination (You only have one life.), Capture (A twist to Capture the Flag), Objective-based missions (Complete a objective, while the enemy team tries to do the same), races, and parachuting. Heists - These are my personal favourite. With up to three of your friends (friends are highly recommended, unless you want to fail the heist repeatedly), you can perform challenging and rewarding missions to obtain lots of cash and exclusive heist vehicles. Unlike basic jobs, these heists involve multiple sub-jobs within them called Heist Setups that must be completed prior to the Heist Finale. As the heist leader, you can set what crew member does what job and their pay for doing that job. Teamwork is essential because the entire team shares one extra life (or none at all if the dificulty is above normal), and if that life is expended, the current mission fails and you'll have to restart it. There are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking. So far I haven't seen any hackers, but I wouldn't doubt their existence. Final Verdict In retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a 9/10 + Amazing story + Excellent gameplay + Fun with friends, and fun without them! + Great graphics + GTA Editor + Heists are fun and replayable for more cash - Glitches ""Now go! I need to meditate. Or masturbate. Or both."" - Trevor Phillips","May 14, 2015, 2:22PM",2,"Apr 18, 2015, 2:12PM",0.821917808219178,657,"{'num_achievements_possible': 75, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.293333333333333, 'num_achievements_attained': 22}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nic0le,540,Nic0le,47.0,117,167.5,Nicole,1,Recommended,534.0,1026,39,17,410

Skyrim is a game that brings hours of gameplay for a very small price, the world is beautiful, the quests bring a challenge to every player and so on. In my opinion, Skyrim has to be one of the best RPG games out there, because you can do so much! Once you finish the main game quests, you can still continue to play this game as there are missions that randomly come up when you speak to characters. If you don't like Skyrim how it is, you can modify it, Steam has a Skyrim Workshop and you can change the way your world looks, you can also visit the Nexus Website which is where a lot of people post their mods. In Skyrim, you can have followers that will follow you into the darkest depths of Skyrim, they can help you fight or they can fight for you, they can even live with you in your home. You end up getting a lot of homes, in most of the cities in Skyrim, my favourite is my house in Solitude, which is in my favourite city. I promise you now, that the only way that this game will annoy you is if you download too many mods and your game crashes (thats happened to me a lot). Now that I have finished the main quests in Skyrim, I just roleplay and live in Solitude, I live with Jessica Alba (a mod).

I wrote something for real! These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think!

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale. I'm just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics.","Jun 14, 2015, 12:25PM",0,"Jun 11, 2015, 11:29AM",0.852053798618684,5502,"{'num_achievements_possible': 29, 'num_achievements_percentage': 0.310344827586206, 'num_achievements_attained': 9}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/JerichoVictorNocte,4688,JerichoVictorNocte,33.0,814,74.8,[S|B] Jericho VioletSkyy,0,Not Recommended,38.0,96,55,2,110

There is also a huge abundance of guns, maps and unique game types to pick from. -I'm sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but I feel that the game's increased difficulty, relative to other first-person shooters, makes it much more rewarding. It is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it. :) -I typically don't pay any attention to the chat/voice communication in multiplayer games such as this, but I quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review. I can tell you that just like in many other games, the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general. Ignore the rage and you'll be fine. :P -CS:GO has a workshop with loads of community made maps that introduce unique game-modes and styles.

You will have no idea what is happening and even worse, you will be at a massive disadvantage while playing because everyone else is in teams. Usually you will be trekking along (normally walking for miles since your fully trained soldier can only run about 20 yards before passing out from exhaustion) you'll hear a pop pop from two miles away and then you are dead, and will have to make another 20 minute trek back to the battlefield. Without co-ordination with a very sizable squad of friends then you will always fail. The game is supposed to be ultra realistic but unfortunately this makes for a very poor game. We don't want to fight long distance firefights against invisible enemies with your gun waving around like you've got cerbrial palsy just because you jogged down some steps. The graphics are definitely good, you've got to give it that, but the performance is trash.

This makes it especially difficult to define who is an Ashkenazi Jew. The people have been defined differently from religious, cultural, or ethnic perspectives. Since the overwhelming majority of Ashkenazi Jews no longer live in Eastern Europe, the isolation that once favored a distinct religious tradition and culture has vanished. The center of Judaism today is once again in Israel, although a large community continues to live abroad, particularly in the United States of America, where Ashkenazi Jews live alongside other Jewish groups. Furthermore, the word Ashkenazi is often used in non-traditional ways, especially in Israel. By conservative and orthodox philosophies, a person can be considered a Jew only if his or her mother was Jewish (meaning, more specifically, either matrilineal descent from a female believed to be present at Mt. Sinai when the ten commandments were given, or else descent from a female who was converted to Judaism before the birth of her children), or if he or she has personally converted to Judaism. This means that a person can be Ashkenazi but not considered a Jew by some of those within the Jewish communities, making the term ""Ashkenazi"" more applicable as a broad ethnicity which evolved from the practice of Judaism in Europe."" -Wikipedia, Introduction to Ashkenazi Jews",,0,"Mar 28, 2013, 3:21PM",0.583333333333333,12,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 0.506637168141592, 'num_achievements_possible': 452, 'num_achievements_attained': 229}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/Conscripts,7,Conscripts,19.0,5,1090.3,Conscript,0,Recommended,240.0,119,1,21,195

We shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy. This went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in ""dibs"", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened. In order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies. Babylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders. I offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted. North of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome. While they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon. I had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them. My civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall. Eventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world. They all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway. Democracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you. Through this, I came to understand American foreign policy.

I just started my first ever save and I already have 16 players injured. Every time I hit continue I was just waiting to see how long the next injury would be. Also, if you thought this game had any semblance of defensive players actually doing anything other than scoring own goals or watching players walk right passed them you are in the wrong place. I realize this is the beta but the release is in 4 days and I don't see them fixing that many problems with a comlpetely broken game. I'll play it again on release and the next patch but I'm back to FM 2014 (not much better) until then. Will update review upon full release and/or next patch. EDIT: Next game after writing this review I had 3 players injured during the game. This takes my total to 19 injuries before the season even begins. My reserve squad is nothing but loans and more injured players as well. Maybe that's just bad luck but seriously how can this many people be injured long term all at once?!? UPDATE: Upon playing the full release I can officialy say that the defense is still terrible and starting a new save fresh for the release has resulted in 9 injuries before the end of the preseason with Crewe Alexandre. So I am no longer playing the 'beta' and as I guessed the problems have still not been sorted out. Guess I'll just be waiting until they patch more to start again.

I would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out. This game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other, but only in Team Fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives, stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching, or dance together! There are nine classes divided into three groups; offense, defense and support. But Team Fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore. Pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout, but they are still very different from each other. You got a fast Scout with little health, and a slow Heavy with a lot of health, and anything inbetween that! There is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to. Valve never added a new class, but they added tons of weapons! Some of them are really silly (punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh, a great way to get silly taunt kills!), while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons (like the Degreaser). However most of the weapons are very situational and I prefer the stock weapons. There are many game modes to play. Capture the point, capture the flag. Payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it, and if you're a fan of tower defense, you will enjoy Mann Vs. Machine! You're a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base. Some of them are small, others are big and really hurts, and others are big and runs fast. But what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional Team Fortress 2, is you can upgrade your weapons. Fire speed, damage, reload speed, damage resistances, running speed, jump speed and so on. It is really fun, and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a Tour! Cosmetic items are a huge deal for many people. Hats! There are so many hats in this game, and they are all so different. There is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play. Many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour! Team Fortress 2 is free to play. Is it pay to win? No. All the weapons you see in the store, are weapons you can get simply by playing, or you can use items to craft the weapon you want. If you buy premium you will receive weapons faster, your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items, and you can trade with others. Trading is a good way to get the weapon you're looking for. It is a lot of fun! It is fun to play the actual game, or just hanging out with people ingame like you can not do in any other game.

Please note that my play time is considerably more than is logged, since I play mostly offline currently. As expected this version of the game isn't perfect. Some of the criticisms outlined in other reviews are accurate, however I must argue against a couple of points made. Firstly the match engine seems fine to me. I seem to score relatively regularly and concede a few here and there, as one might expect. It doesn't seem unbalanced from my point of view, but then I suppose I don't always expect it to work everytime just because I want it to, and rather I work on my tactics to make them more effective. Secondly, a couple of other reviews complain about the new 'confusing' layout. While I admit I had a hard time finding certain things initially within the sidebar, it really doesn't take long to get used to it and, indeed, I actually rather like the new look. This game takes the solid foundations set by Football Manager 2014 as a huge improvement over the problematic 2013 version, and builds on it. It gives a fresh new look, which isn't something I would have said it needed but now it's here, I like it. In summary then, from my own personal experience, this game is very good indeed. It improves in subtle ways on the previous entry in the series, and from what i've seen so far it doesn't really take anything away either. Make of this what you will, those people who complain might disagree with me, but then i'm not from the school of 'instant success or GTFO'. Buy it, if you are a fan of the series. I picked it up for a little over 20, and i'd say for the amount i'll play it, that makes it the bargain of the year.",,0,"Nov 24, 2014, 12:44AM",0.529411764705882,17,"{'num_achievements_attained': None, 'num_achievements_percentage': None, 'num_achievements_possible': None}",http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198163122308,9,76561198163122308,,8,14.2,Blodmonath,0,Recommended,,0,0,0,0

As someone who's been playing Dota since its beginnings, the first thing you may recognize and notice is that many of the games features such as map layout, heroes, and gameplay is almost, exactly the same but with a better and more refined look with updated graphics, making the entire map feel more lively and a refresh of old. Of course, that's all good but at the heart of Dota as many may know is its gameplay and replayability. The amount of hours I've pumped back in the first Dota was unforgettable, clocking more than +2500 hours of time played. Just like Dota 1, Dota 2 shares the exact same formula, pick a hero, last hit creeps/farm up gold, and win team fights to gain victory. Simple and straight forward, right? Wrong. If you played back in Dota 1, you'd come to realize the more you played it, the game had a fairly, high skill requirement in order to do well, especially if you're pushing to be top in a region or tournament. The amount of time and practice makes perfect as you will want to eventually learn every hero, how they synergize and working together with your teammates. It gets rough but extremely fun and satisfying, especially if you're on high level play. Unfortunately though, most people tend to ignore these kinds of games since difficulty is fairly high or they just can't stand to put the effort to actually play the game well and properly, otherwise various issues can occur, such as getting hate from other players and getting reported for not being able to play well. It's an immediate turn off and can easily have people packing their bags and finding another game. Unfortunately, again, this is thanks to the toxic communities that have spawned across all MOBA genre games. You will always have to deal with these kinds of people who will give you  and you have to bare with it as those kinds of players won't be going away anytime soon. I strongly believe competitive games have the highest chance to have ragers compared to other types of games out there and it's tough to avoid the negativity that comes with it. Now with some additions, they've added a store where you can purchase from hero skins, UI skins, to different voices for the default announcer, different couriers and selling/buying through the steam market. The thing that seperates skins here compared to others is that skins come in seperate, armor pieces you can equip on a hero, meaning you can say, keep a helmet and sell the other parts, like gloves to someone else on the steam market. It goes to show how much control the players have and what they have in their hands. The best part of all this, is that all heroes are free right off the bat to everyone, so no need to spend money and unlock the heroes you want to play. It allows us, as the players to explore and see what heroes we enjoy playing the most and if you're into cosmetics, you also have the option to buy a skin. The business model for me personally, is fair and likeable as I've had no issues with it whatsoever, it's equal for both the customer and developer. Now, while the gameplay is still the same and fun at its core, what else has been added by Valve? Well, we now have various events that take from time to time, usually worldwide holidays such as Christmas or Halloween are some examples. These events bring in replay value to want and play the game more such as getting limited skins for heroes, UI skins, couriers or just straight up rare items that can be sold across the entire steam market so you can get some funds put into your wallet for perhaps other items/skins on the market or even just saving up to buy another game entirely from either the steam store or in-game store. They've also made several changes to the UI compared to back in Warcraft 3. The UI is bigger and straight forward, and buying items through the shop are easily seen as everything is now categorized properly, and accessing them with a simple click. It's easily noticeable but just in case, you may have noticed, some heroes have not been put into the game yet and are missing. It's mainly due to copyright issues with Blizzard, seeing as how Brewmaster was a Pandaren from Warcraft and now Valve has changed him to a Koala beast of some sort? In fact, every champion for the most part, have been changed in their appearance because Dota started off by using Blizzard races and even some famous lore characters such as Thrall (Disruptor) or Rexxar (Beastmaster). It's certainly slowed down some heroes from being brought back, the recent being Legion Commander (male to female) and Terrorblade (no longer the demon hunter/Illidan). Valve still has a few more heroes to change and get out, such as Techies, so if you're a big Techies fan and/or mainer, you're going to have to wait a while longer until Valve finally pushes him out. Alright, and now my few personal grips about this game other than having a toxic community as I mentioned earlier throughout these types of games. I just do not appreciate or enjoy the art style that Valve has brought into this game. NOT in terms of quality but art style. The quality is fine for some but most heroes I feel, lost their identity and instead of something different, or unique, Valve just made most of the heroes look ugly and feel uninspired in my honest opinion. I mean now Earthshaker now looks like a mutated version of Beast from X-Men with a mix of a Koala (similar to the new Brewmaster). Hell, I still appreciate Blizzards art style so much more in Warcraft 3 than this new look, look at Pudge and Slardar, they had the look, voice and feel back in Warcraft 3 but now it's just not as strong anymore here. Even the almighty and fearful Zeus doesn't look like an intimidating god anymore, but a scientist. Another thing that I do not find a lot of fun a whole lot anymore is the gameplay itself, yes, the core gameplay. It's literally been the same thing over and over, nothing new or innovative, just a rinse and repeat of picking a hero, farming up gold for items, and winning team fights. Maybe it's just me after playing thousands of hours in this genre or perhaps if you take a look past the gameplay and look at what it really offers, there's really nothing going for it. Last hitting isn't fun anymore, as that's all you're doing most of the time early on, with team fights mid to late game (unless you personally find it fun). The worst part, is you will fall behind if you say die a few times to an opponent carry, it pigeon holds you because now your team has little to no retaliation or chance of hoping to win since that carry will just roll face your entire team and there's a decent chance someone on your team will call you out, meaning more anger and frustration can occur. I can safely say as a long time Dota 1 player/fan, Dota is still fun but it's not fun if you want to play decently at the average level because the amount of mechanics people know in that level will put you in a disadvantage if you just learn a few because most just don't have time to do it. So what can I say, I mean in the end, this is basically Dota 2.0 with better graphics, same gameplay like the original, a few added features like events, and the in-game store associated with the steam market. Everything looks great except the art style for most heroes (personal opinion) and of course, the ease of access to newcomers while it may seem straight forward, it gets more complicated in-depth, meaning there's a harder learning curve and barrier to pass through to fully enjoy the game at its fullest, meaning you'll need to spend some time and practice.","Nov 27, 2014, 3:51PM",0,"Apr 10, 2014, 9:39PM",0.7826086956521741,23,"{'num_achievements_percentage': 1.0, 'num_achievements_possible': 8, 'num_achievements_attained': 8}",http://steamcommunity.com/id/treantwuver,18,treantwuver,60.0,5,129.3,Treantwuver,0,Recommended,127.0,0,3,8,123

AI are smart as difficulty goes up but it's good enough on normal difficulty for it to be fun. The skills system is extremely modular and can go which ever way you want making it the ultimate RPG game. There is an infinite number of quests that are randomly generated but the normal game content of quests is enough to keep you going for a few hundred hours. UI and menu and items from loot to smithing to alchemy are all well done and can be changed or improved on by mods. Graphics 8/10 The base vanilla game has some pretty low textures in comparison to some next-gen games and the colour filter of the game is really grey and boring but can be changed yet again with the help of mods. With mods, the graphics get changed to 10/10, sometimes even competing with next-gen games and look even better. Audio/Music 10/10 The voice acting in this game is superb even if you can hear the same voice actor over and over. All dialogue is voiced and most NPCs have interesting back stories or lines of dialogue. You won't start hearing dialogue appear over and over until you've played the game for a couple of hours but it doesn't at all take away from the immersion of the game. The music is fantastic and one of the best video game soundtracks I've heard. Jeremy Soule does an amazing job as usual creating a tone and setting for the world of Skyirm. The game sounds from the world are really well done. From the sounds of fire burning away at corpses to the cries of the wolves or bears. The ambience of travelling through the forests to the blowing winds of the snow peaked mountains to the ambience of dungeons and the soothing relaxing tone of the taverns, Skyrim makes no mistakes when it comes to immersing you into the game world through music and audio. Content/Replayability 10/10 The amount of content this game has is far beyond any other game I've ever played. With only 2 large DLCs being Dawnguard and Dragonborn, it still manages to have content of which I've never seen before. This game's size in terms of content could match even that of large scale MMO titles and is not as repetitive as those games due to the fact you can play this game however you want. Skyrim is the game that'll define a genre of RPG games and Bethesda has not compromised much in terms of content in the game. Overall 9.5/10 No game is ever perfect but The Elder Scrolls Skyrim comes close to being one of the best games over made in my opinion. The sheer amount of work put into this extremely immersive world is beyond that of any RPG I've ever played.

The game itself takes place in Skyrim's land. A civil war between Stormcloak and the Imperial Legion. The Story Begins With The Jailed Guy, Who Escaped And Take A Journy To Nearby Riverwood. The Guy Gone To A Fight With A Dragon With Whiterun's Guards, After They Killed It, The Played (Guy) Absorbed The Dragon's Blood, Because He Has The Ability To Absorb Blood, Guards Got Shocked By That Absorption; The Player ( Guy) Is The Dragonborn; The History Of Dragons And More. Gameplay The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, Can Be playable Either a first or third-person, But Mainly First-Person. Skyrim's Genre RPG, Action and Adventure, But Maily RPG. It's Pretty Rare To See An Impressed Griping RPG. Skryim is not a normal RPG nor Action, It's an exceptional pretty rare to see RPG and Action. The Game Itself will have been taken from you more than 100 hours, I already have reached to ""Almost"" 100 Hour and atleast haven't reached at 45%. It's So So So Big Game that Nobody can expect its lengh (Expect for the main story its short), Speakin' generally 350 hour means 60% of the game Pretty Sure, Last Word ""Time Killer"". Graphics Story AWESOME, Gameplay is better than the story and Graphics is the head of Skyrim or skyrim's skill. Why The Graphics is the best of Skyrim? Beautiful environment, Beautiful shadow effects, The Appropriate Atmosphere specially in a combat. everything you have seen in Uncharted 1, 2 and 3 you'll find better than Uncharted's environment. Head Of Graphics.. Bethesda labeled correctely. Not Incorrectely. Even in low feels pretty good feels in high comparing it to some. ""MASTERPIECE"". Sounds Skyrim's Sounds is the opposite of reality which means ""imagination"" That Really didn't work!! Hit The Floor Feels Shredding Cotton Or Wool, Mostly Every Single Sound Feels Shredding; Not neat. That is the first negative in the game. Doesn't feel happy or something feels BAD. Hit A Person Feels An Electronic thing has blow away. All I Can Say Good But Still Very Very Veryx10 Not Neat. Music FUS RO DAH. Fighting A Dragon A Track Plays To Change Your Reaction Effects Into Excited. When Bored In Playing A Track Plays To Change Your Boredom Effects. Absorbing A Dragon Soul Makes Civilians Shocked And The Player Too; From The Awesome Happiness. Every Track Can Change Your Affects And Makes You Wonder Why Singers Wouldn't Make Those Emotional Tracks?; Skyrim's Tracks. Pretty Rare To See, Pretty Rare To Find, Pretty Rare To Effect Your Emotional Feeling, Pretty Rare To Find Better, Pretty Rare To Everything You Could Ever Feel Free To Ask For. The Verdict The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Took Game Of The Year Before, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Took Game Of The Year 2011. For Me, It's Prettyx10 Rare To Give A Game A 10 Out Of 10, Sence All The Games that I Have Been Playing It, Skyrim Is The Best RPG Game I Have Ever Played. Fallout 3 Took A 10 Out Of 10, In My Personal Opinion Just 3 Game Took A 10 Out Of 10. In Every RPG Game I Don't Spend More Than 50 Hours. I Just Have Spend My More Than 50 Hours In Borderlands 2 And Skyrim, The Best Three RPG Games Of My Entire Are: Final Fantasy 7, Fallout 3 and Borderlands 2 But Skyrim Is Very Very Very Away Better Than All Of Them. Skyrim Is A Brilliant Game And ""Time Killer Or Waster"". Skyrim Is One Of The Very Best Games Of The Entire History. You'll Never Forget The Experience And Everything. The Best Method Of Modifying Describing And Visualizing It Is PLAY IT. Story: 9.5/10 Gameplay: 9.5/10 Graphics: 9.5/10 Sounds: 7/10 Music: 10/10 + Positives Side Missions Can Make A Big Story+Awesome Leveling Up System+Great Story+350 Hours Means 60% Of The Game; So Big Game+Training A Skill Can Cause Alot Of Time+Music Matters In The Gameplay Reaction+Nobody Can Find Better Than This RPG Game (Just RPG)+Gives You The Freedom To Explore+War Battles Are Pretty Fun+Awesome Dragons Combat - Negatives -Still Bugy And Glitch-You Might Get stick In A Spot-Not Neat Sounds-Pretty Easy To Cheat-Isn't Easy To Learn For Some People Skyrim, The Best You'll Find, MUST-PLAY! If You Hate RPG Games So This Will Change Your Opinion, And If You Love So You Are Missing Something Pretty Awesome. Either Play It Or Regret That You Haven't Played It.

The story is interesting and long(After 22hours I am still not done with it!), while some missions are boring, but the graphics, the optimization, and the voice acting are all awesome. The controls are great, but the Helicopters' are not realy, but I don't care about it. The game got lot of mini games(Tennis, Golf, Cycle reaces, running races etc), with a huge variety of cars, and car customization items, and a good amount of customizable weapons. The Online is also good, but sometimes realy unfair due to the character transfer from Consoles, and I had to fight in a TDM as a lv. 5 character against some lv. 50-60 guys, and that was unfair. Online got a bad sport system, what is not the best at this point, because I don't wanted to become one, but I realy wanted to leve the match, because it was full of, well idiots. Heists and other game modes are awesome, just like the character customization.

By bundling the game with the micro transaction money, anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund. Not only is this a violation of FTC regulation and EU law, it is the biggest  move I have seen on steam yet. I would have rather had my $60 go to the WarZ devs than this .

This time they have gone a step down in my opinion. The new layout is okay. The interface bar on the left side instead of the top is a great new thing, but from there on its just worse to be honost. The tactic section is clumsy and very few things are better and alot of things are worse. Besides from that it seems like the match engine is way worse too. Normally there would be some sense of stability, but now i can play as Man City and win 8-0 against Sporting(POR) and then lose againt some 3rd division team 3-6 in the next match. There's an unbelieveable amount of injuries which is so damn frustrating. The search engine has got a makeover that is for the better, although i seem to have a problem finding young players from outside Europe without making the leagues playable. All in all a turn for the worse, but most of the problems could be solved with some updates and maybe a choice to chose the old tactics interface (please??).
